## Executive Summary

This is a **high-quality strategic body of work**: thoughtful, energetic, and unusually deep for early-stage marketing docs. There is a clear growth thesis (guest flywheel), a coherent emotional promise (“every guest, every memory”), and strong founder-level ambition.

The primary issue is **not lack of ideas**. It is **lack of narrative and commercial compression**.

Right now, the doc set reads like:
- a wedding product strategy,
- a multi-segment SaaS pricing architecture,
- a marketplace/channel strategy,
- and a future consumer social platform vision.

All four can eventually be true — but together, today, they create strategy sprawl and execution risk.

### Overall assessment
- **Strategic creativity:** 9/10
- **Market intuition:** 8/10
- **Messaging quality:** 8/10
- **Commercial coherence:** 6/10
- **Execution readiness:** 6/10
- **Cross-doc consistency:** 4/10

## Review Rubric (Marketing Lens)

To keep this review objective, each document was assessed on:

1. **ICP clarity** — Is the buyer explicit, narrow, and actionable?
2. **Value proposition strength** — Is there a clear “why choose us” narrative?
3. **Conversion readiness** — Does this translate into funnel decisions and CTAs?
4. **Commercial coherence** — Are pricing, incentives, and economics consistent?
5. **Execution quality** — Can a team actually run this without ambiguity?
6. **Strategic fit** — Does this support the near-term core strategy (vs distract)?

### Scorecard by Document (1–10)

| Document | ICP Clarity | Value Prop | Conversion Readiness | Commercial Coherence | Execution Quality | Strategic Fit |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `MARKETING-PLAN.md` | 9 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 7 |
| `PRICING-MODELS.md` | 7 | 7 | 7 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| `PRO-ACCOUNT-DEEP-DIVE.md` | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 |
| `ACCOUNT-TYPES.md` | 7 | 6 | 6 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| `PURPLE-COW-CHANNELS.md` | 8 | 7 | 6 | 6 | 5 | 7 |
| `NAMING-BRAINSTORM.md` | 8 | 8 | 5 | 7 | 7 | 7 |
| `SOCIAL-APP-EXPLORATION.md` | 7 | 8 | 5 | 6 | 6 | 5 |
| `WHATS-MISSING.md` | 8 | 7 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 9 |

## What’s Working Extremely Well

## 1) Emotional core is strong and sticky
The core promise (capturing “moments between moments” that photographers miss) is compelling, memorable, and easy to market.

## 2) Wedding ICP focus is well-understood
Personas are specific and practical (couples + planners + photographers), with useful budget anchoring language.

## 3) Flywheel thinking is advanced
The guest email/customer loop is a legitimate strategic advantage if executed with compliance discipline.

## 4) Pro channel thinking is unusually mature
`PRO-ACCOUNT-DEEP-DIVE.md` is the strongest strategy doc in the set: clear economics, clean model framing, useful workflow design.

## 5) Creative channel generation is a true strength
`PURPLE-COW-CHANNELS.md` includes genuinely differentiated ideas, not generic “do content and SEO” fluff.

## 6) You already include self-critique
`WHATS-MISSING.md` is excellent — it demonstrates strategic self-awareness and practical prioritization instincts.

---

## Critical Issues (Highest Priority)

## 1) Cross-doc pricing contradictions undermine trust
There are multiple numeric mismatches across docs. This is a top-priority fix because pricing inconsistency damages buyer trust, internal alignment, and partner confidence.

Examples:
- **Pro referral commission**
  - `ACCOUNT-TYPES.md`: Pro gets **$0.20/guest** (20% framing).
  - `PRO-ACCOUNT-DEEP-DIVE.md` and `PRICING-MODELS.md`: Pro gets **$0.60/guest** in the unified model.
- **Venue pricing**
  - `ACCOUNT-TYPES.md`: Starter/Growth/Unlimited at **$29/$79/$149**.
  - `PRICING-MODELS.md`: **$39/$89/$179** (+ different constraints).
- **Open event tier prices**
  - `PRICING-MODELS.md` Option A table: **$49/$99/$199/$399**.
  - Same doc (pricing page section): **$29/$59/$99/$199**.
- **Math error**
  - `PRICING-MODELS.md` includes “**150 guests = $150**” despite core model being $2/guest.

**Marketing impact:** prospects perceive pricing opacity or sloppiness, which increases drop-off at checkout and hurts referral confidence.

---

## Evidence Ledger — Contradictions That Need Immediate Reconciliation

This section translates strategic critique into concrete reconciliation work.

| Topic | Source A | Source B | Why It’s Dangerous | Required Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pro referral payout | `ACCOUNT-TYPES.md` describes ~`$0.20/guest` commission framing | `PRO-ACCOUNT-DEEP-DIVE.md` + `PRICING-MODELS.md` center on `$0.60/guest` | Partner pitch inconsistency reduces trust and slows Pro adoption | Lock one model and deprecate old numbers everywhere |
| Venue plan prices | `ACCOUNT-TYPES.md` uses `$29/$79/$149` | `PRICING-MODELS.md` uses `$39/$89/$179` | Finance modeling and sales scripts diverge | Assign a canonical pricing table owner and version |
| Open-event tier cards | Tier table uses `$49/$99/$199/$399` | Pricing-page section shows `$29/$59/$99/$199` | High risk of checkout mismatch and support friction | Choose one launch schedule and archive alternates as tests |
| Core wedding math | “150 guests = $150” appears in one comparison section | Core model is `$2/guest` | Basic arithmetic inconsistency creates perceived sloppiness | Correct all anchor math and add final QA pass for numeric claims |

---

## 2) Strategy breadth currently exceeds execution focus
The set spans weddings, open events, festivals, venues, pros, and a social app roadmap. This breadth creates a focus tax.

**Risk:** instead of dominating one beachhead (weddings + one growth channel), you distribute attention across many models before nailing repeatable PMF.

**Marketing consequence:** weaker message clarity, weaker funnel performance, slower payback on campaigns.

---

## 3) Forecast confidence is too aggressive relative to evidence
Several docs use assertive growth/economics language (high conversion assumptions, large monthly event targets, near-zero CAC flywheel confidence) without confidence bands or evidence hierarchy.

**Recommendation:** shift from single-point forecasts to:
- Base / upside / downside scenarios,
- Explicit assumptions per metric,
- “What must be true” gating criteria.

This preserves ambition while improving strategic credibility.

---

## 4) “No app required” vs app/social vision needs message architecture
`SOCIAL-APP-EXPLORATION.md` rightly argues optional app evolution, but market-facing messaging could become contradictory if not tightly staged.

**Needed framing:**
- Today: “No app required for guests” (core differentiator).
- Later: “App optional for power users and memory vault.”

Without this architecture, you risk confusing core buyers and diluting your strongest current conversion hook.

---

## 5) Compliance risk is acknowledged but not operationalized
Email capture/flywheel strategy is central everywhere, but legal/compliance execution is still mostly conceptual.

Given how central this is to growth claims, compliance should move from “missing” to “core operating requirement” immediately.

---

## Doc-by-Doc Critique

## `MARKETING-PLAN.md`
**Strengths**
- Strong narrative arc and emotional buyer psychology.
- Useful persona framing and channel ideas.
- Good momentum-building structure (phases, KPIs, checklists).

**Criticisms**
- Over-commits to too many parallel motions in early phases.
- Forecasts are confident but lightly evidenced.
- Mixes strategy, campaign ideas, operations, product roadmap, and channel experimentation into one long document — harder to execute from.

**Recommendation**
- Split into:
  1) Strategic thesis + ICP + positioning,
  2) 90-day GTM operating plan,
  3) KPI scorecard with assumptions and owner per metric.

---

## `PRICING-MODELS.md`
**Strengths**
- Excellent breadth across account/event types.
- Good recognition that usage contexts need different pricing mechanics.

**Criticisms**
- Internal contradictions (tiers, numbers, comparison math).
- Too many pricing architectures simultaneously for an early-stage product.
- Risks decision fatigue on the pricing page.

**Recommendation**
- Establish one pricing “source of truth” table.
- Prioritize only launch-critical models first; mark others as future-state.
- Add a simple buyer decision tree (“Which pricing applies to me?”).

---

## `PRO-ACCOUNT-DEEP-DIVE.md`
**Strengths**
- Best document in the set for clarity and model discipline.
- Unified model framing is commercially elegant.
- Practical workflows (handoff, dashboard, payouts) are well reasoned.

**Criticisms**
- Still needs operational guardrails: attribution edge cases, fraud prevention, payout disputes, and cannibalization management.
- Assumes smooth channel behavior without enough fail-case handling.

**Recommendation**
- Add an “operational risks and controls” section for referral abuse, payout exceptions, and ownership conflicts.

---

## `ACCOUNT-TYPES.md`
**Strengths**
- Good conceptual bridge between account models.
- Strong rationale for recurring channels (venues/pros).

**Criticisms**
- Now partially stale vs newer Pro and pricing docs.
- Conflicting economics create alignment risk.

**Recommendation**
- Reposition as high-level architecture doc only, and defer all numbers to canonical pricing/pro docs.

---

## `PURPLE-COW-CHANNELS.md`
**Strengths**
- Genuinely differentiated, non-obvious growth ideas.
- Good channel categorization and quick-start sequencing.

**Criticisms**
- Lacks a strict experimentation framework (owner, expected CAC, test budget, pass/fail criteria).
- A few ideas may be exciting but operationally expensive relative to immediate impact.

**Recommendation**
- Add an experiment scorecard for each channel:
  - Hypothesis,
  - Cost,
  - Time-to-signal,
  - Success threshold,
  - Kill criteria.

---

## `NAMING-BRAINSTORM.md`
**Strengths**
- Strong naming frameworks and high-quality qualitative evaluation.
- Good brand personality mapping and practical recommendation logic.

**Criticisms**
- Missing legal and commercial validation layer (trademark collision risk, domain economics, linguistic checks).
- “Brunch test” is useful but should not be treated as final validation.

**Recommendation**
- Add a final validation phase:
  - Preliminary trademark screening,
  - Domain acquisition feasibility,
  - 20-customer preference test,
  - Paid ad click test for top 2 names.

---

## `SOCIAL-APP-EXPLORATION.md`
**Strengths**
- Excellent long-term strategic imagination.
- Thoughtful architecture and phased rollout.
- Honest risk section increases credibility.

**Criticisms**
- Could pull attention from immediate PMF/monetization goals.
- Introduces a second narrative before the first is fully proven.
- Significant product, moderation, and ops burden.

**Recommendation**
- Keep as north-star document, but gate execution with hard milestone triggers (e.g., activation/retention thresholds in core product).

---

## `WHATS-MISSING.md`
**Strengths**
- Highly practical and well-prioritized.
- Correctly identifies strategic blind spots.

**Criticisms**
- Missing one critical category: **document governance/version control** across strategy docs.

**Recommendation**
- Add a “single source of truth” process:
  - Canonical owner for each domain (pricing, GTM, brand, roadmap),
  - Last-updated tags,
  - Change log for critical numbers.

---

## Cross-Doc Strategic Risks

1. **Version drift on core economics** (already visible).
2. **Message dilution from parallel market narratives** (weddings vs all-events vs social platform).
3. **Overproduction of strategy before proof loops** (many ideas, fewer validated loops).
4. **Compliance dependence on growth thesis without equivalent execution maturity.**

---

## What to Keep, What to Cut, What to Delay

## Keep (double down now)
- Wedding-first positioning and emotional narrative.
- Pro channel strategy (especially unified Pro model economics).
- Guest flywheel as a growth system (with compliance-first implementation).
- Purple-cow experimentation style (but with tighter test discipline).

## Cut (for now)
- Simultaneous external narrative around too many segments (weddings + venues + festivals + social app at equal weight).
- Redundant pricing variants that produce decision paralysis.
- Any market-facing claim that cannot be operationally supported in the next 90 days.

## Delay (until core milestones are hit)
- Broad social app positioning as a primary GTM narrative.
- Full venue/festival expansion messaging before wedding funnel metrics are stable.
- Secondary monetization complexity (advanced add-ons, broad enterprise packaging) before base conversion is proven.

---

## Prioritized Recommendations

## P0 (Do now: next 7–14 days)
1. **Create one canonical pricing/economics table** and align all docs to it.
2. **Define 6-month strategic focus** (recommended: weddings + one repeatable channel, likely Pro or guest-flywheel).
3. **Publish a messaging hierarchy** to prevent “no-app” vs “app vision” confusion.
4. **Convert legal/compliance from “missing” to committed launch requirement.**
5. **Introduce doc governance** (owner, version stamp, source of truth).

## P1 (Next 30 days)
1. Build a **launch playbook** (day-by-day, owner-by-owner).
2. Formalize **channel experiment framework** with kill criteria.
3. Finalize **referral program mechanics** (incentives, abuse prevention, attribution).
4. Tighten KPI model with confidence bands (base/upside/downside).

## P2 (Next 60–90 days)
1. Validate naming finalists with legal + market testing.
2. Add retention playbooks for Pro/Venue before scaling recurring channels.
3. Set explicit gate metrics for any social app expansion investment.

---

## Decision Sequence (Non-Negotiable Order of Operations)

To prevent strategy drift, sequence decisions in this exact order:

1. **Canonical economics first**  
   Finalize the single source-of-truth for retail price, Pro margin/commission, and venue pricing.

2. **One external story second**  
   Publish the primary message architecture for the next 6 months (recommended: wedding-first, no-app-required for guests).

3. **One growth loop third**  
   Choose the dominant growth loop to scale first (recommended: Pro-driven or guest-flywheel, not both equally).

4. **Channel expansion fourth**  
   Scale only channels that pass pre-defined CAC/payback thresholds.

5. **Platform expansion fifth**  
   Keep social app work as gated roadmap investment, tied to hard activation/retention milestones.

---

## High-Impact Rewrite Directives (If You Revise the Strategy Set)

These are the highest leverage documentation improvements:

1. Add a **“Current truth” header block** to every strategy doc:
   - Last updated date
   - Owner
   - Canonical references
   - Superseded sections (if any)

2. In pricing docs, separate clearly:
   - **Live launch pricing**
   - **Future experiments**
   - **Deprecated assumptions**

3. Convert all numeric claims into a standardized format:
   - assumption,
   - formula,
   - resulting value,
   - confidence level (high/medium/low).

4. Add a one-page **message architecture map**:
   - Core promise,
   - 3 proof pillars,
   - Segment-specific adaptations,
   - Explicit “not saying this yet” boundary.

5. Add one **single GTM operating dashboard** used across all docs:
   - weekly targets,
   - owners,
   - pass/fail status.

---

## 30/60/90 Marketing Operating Plan (Suggested)

## First 30 Days
- Resolve all contradictory numbers and publish one canonical economics sheet.
- Publish a single external narrative: wedding-first, no-app-required-for-guests.
- Finalize launch playbook and assign clear owners for each motion.
- Implement compliance baseline: consent language, opt-in/opt-out logic, policy updates.

## Day 31–60
- Run 3–5 high-signal growth experiments from Purple Cow list with pass/fail criteria.
- Ship referral mechanics for one channel first (e.g., Pro referral).
- Build weekly KPI ritual (traffic → signup → event creation → paid → upload participation).
- Freeze non-critical strategy branching until learning loops stabilize.

## Day 61–90
- Scale only experiments that meet efficiency and conversion thresholds.
- Lock naming decision via legal + customer signal, then align brand artifacts.
- Prepare venue/pro retention playbooks before meaningful recurring channel spend.
- Reassess app/social roadmap only against hard threshold metrics.

## Red-Team View: Likely Objections from a Skeptical Operator (and How to Preempt Them)

These are the criticisms an experienced CMO/operator/investor will likely raise. Preempting them materially increases strategic credibility.

| Likely Objection | Why They’ll Raise It | Best Preemptive Response |
|---|---|---|
| “This is too many businesses at once.” | Weddings, venues, festivals, and social platform imply four motions. | Explicitly sequence: weddings first, one expansion channel second, platform optional later. |
| “Pricing looks inconsistent and therefore untrustworthy.” | Contradictory numbers signal weak operating discipline. | Publish one canonical economics table and version-lock all strategy docs. |
| “Your growth forecasts are optimistic.” | Ambitious numbers without confidence ranges look narrative-driven. | Use scenario bands + assumption registry + monthly reforecast cadence. |
| “The moat is unclear; features are copyable.” | AI/filter/watermark features can be cloned quickly. | Emphasize distribution + partner channels + data/relationship flywheel, not feature novelty. |
| “Compliance could break the flywheel.” | Email/consent risks can invalidate core growth loop if mishandled. | Treat compliance as product requirement, not legal appendix; operationalize consent and suppression logic. |
| “No-app messaging conflicts with app ambition.” | Mixed story weakens positioning discipline. | Anchor phased message: no app required now, optional app later for memory vault/power users. |
| “Channel ideas are creative but untested.” | Creativity without test rigor is expensive. | Tie each channel to hypothesis, budget, signal window, and stop-loss criteria. |
| “Who owns the narrative and the numbers?” | Multi-doc strategy can drift without governance. | Assign clear doc ownership and a monthly strategic sync + changelog. |
| “Recurring channels can churn quickly.” | Pro/Venue growth can reverse if onboarding/retention weak. | Define health scores, churn triggers, and early retention interventions before scaling. |
| “Are you building strategy docs faster than learning?” | Early-stage teams should maximize feedback loops. | Enforce a build-measure-learn cadence with doc updates only after measured outcomes. |

---

## Final Readout for Leadership

If leadership executes only five things from this review, do these:

1. **Eliminate all economics contradictions immediately.**
2. **Choose one narrative for the next two quarters.**
3. **Scale only one growth loop at a time with hard thresholds.**
4. **Make compliance and instrumentation first-class launch work.**
5. **Treat documentation as an operating system (owned, versioned, audited).**

Do this, and the strategy transitions from “high-potential but diffuse” to “focused, credible, and executable.”

## Assumption Audit Checklist (Use Before Publishing Any Strategy Update)

Use this as a mandatory QA gate for future strategy docs and revisions:

### Messaging & Positioning
- [ ] Is the primary audience for this doc explicitly named in the first screen?
- [ ] Does the document support the current quarter’s core narrative?
- [ ] Are any future-state ideas clearly marked as future-state (not current GTM)?

### Pricing & Economics
- [ ] Do all prices match the canonical economics table?
- [ ] Do all formulas reconcile arithmetically?
- [ ] Are all incentives (discounts, commission, margin) mutually consistent?
- [ ] Are scenario assumptions labeled (base / upside / downside)?

### Funnel & Growth Claims
- [ ] Does each conversion assumption have either evidence or a confidence label?
- [ ] Is each growth channel tied to a measurable success threshold?
- [ ] Is there a clear owner and review cadence for each KPI?

### Compliance & Risk
- [ ] Does any email/consent workflow align with current legal policy?
- [ ] Are risky tactics explicitly reviewed for abuse/fraud/compliance failure modes?
- [ ] Is there a documented fallback if key assumptions fail?

### Execution Clarity
- [ ] Does this doc include decision owner, last updated date, and version context?
- [ ] Are contradictions with other strategy docs explicitly resolved?
- [ ] Does this doc reduce ambiguity for execution teams (not add it)?

---

## Experiment Scorecard Template (Recommended Standard)

To convert creative ideas into disciplined growth learning, every test should use one standard format:

| Field | Required Content |
|---|---|
| Experiment Name | Short and specific (e.g., “DJ script insertion pilot”) |
| Objective | Which funnel stage this improves (awareness/activation/revenue/referral) |
| Hypothesis | If X is done, Y metric should improve by Z |
| Audience | Exact segment targeted |
| Channel | Where and how test runs |
| Budget Cap | Maximum spend/time allowed |
| Primary KPI | Single deciding metric |
| Secondary KPIs | Supporting quality metrics |
| Success Threshold | Minimum outcome to scale |
| Stop-Loss Threshold | Trigger to terminate the test |
| Time-to-Signal | How long before a valid read |
| Owner | Responsible person |
| Decision Date | Date to scale/iterate/kill |
| Postmortem Summary | What was learned and next action |

Using this template across channels will prevent idea overload and keep execution tied to measurable outcomes.

---

## Documentation Governance Matrix (Recommended)

To stop cross-doc drift, assign explicit ownership and update cadence:

| Strategy Domain | Canonical Doc | Suggested Owner Role | Update Cadence | Approval Rule |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Core positioning & ICP | `MARKETING-PLAN.md` | Founder / Marketing Lead | Monthly | Major narrative changes require leadership sign-off |
| Pricing & economics | `PRICING-MODELS.md` (+ Pro economics references) | Founder / Finance owner | Biweekly during launch | Any price/incentive change must update all downstream docs same day |
| Pro channel model | `PRO-ACCOUNT-DEEP-DIVE.md` | Partnerships / Growth Lead | Monthly | Commission or payout changes require finance + legal check |
| Account architecture | `ACCOUNT-TYPES.md` | Product Strategy Lead | Monthly | No standalone numbers unless synced from canonical pricing |
| Channel experiments | `PURPLE-COW-CHANNELS.md` | Growth Lead | Weekly active experiments, monthly archive | Every channel entry must include status (planned/running/scaled/killed) |
| Naming & brand | `NAMING-BRAINSTORM.md` | Brand Lead | As decisions progress | Final naming changes require legal checkpoint |
| Platform vision roadmap | `SOCIAL-APP-EXPLORATION.md` | Product Lead | Quarterly | Roadmap phase movement requires metric gate evidence |
| Gap tracking | `WHATS-MISSING.md` | Operations / PMO | Biweekly | Closed items must link to completed artifact/doc |

If this governance matrix is enforced, strategy docs become an operating system instead of a static brainstorm archive.

---

## Doc-Specific 14-Day Fix Pack (Fastest Path to Coherence)

This is the minimum set of revisions that will materially improve strategic credibility in two weeks.

| Doc | Highest-Leverage Fixes | Expected Impact |
|---|---|---|
| `PRICING-MODELS.md` | Remove conflicting numbers, correct all arithmetic anchors, mark non-live pricing as experiments | Immediate trust gain in pricing conversations |
| `ACCOUNT-TYPES.md` | Remove stale economics, point to canonical pricing references only | Eliminates partner/investor confusion |
| `MARKETING-PLAN.md` | Compress to one near-term GTM story and move speculative items to appendix | Stronger execution focus |
| `PRO-ACCOUNT-DEEP-DIVE.md` | Add abuse/fraud/dispute controls and attribution edge-case policy | Higher channel reliability and payout confidence |
| `PURPLE-COW-CHANNELS.md` | Add experiment status + KPI threshold fields per channel | Turns idea list into execution system |
| `SOCIAL-APP-EXPLORATION.md` | Add hard metric gates for each phase transition | Prevents roadmap overreach |
| `NAMING-BRAINSTORM.md` | Add legal/trademark + market validation checklist | Reduces costly rebrand risk |
| `WHATS-MISSING.md` | Add “governance + source of truth” as explicit high-priority gap | Maintains long-term strategic consistency |

---

## Impact × Effort Prioritization Board (Execution Triage)

Use this board to decide what to do first when team bandwidth is constrained.

### High Impact / Low Effort (Do Immediately)
1. Correct all pricing/math contradictions across docs.
2. Mark one canonical pricing doc and reference it everywhere else.
3. Add version/owner header to each strategy doc.
4. Clarify one near-term narrative: wedding-first + no-app-required-for-guests.
5. Add confidence labels to major forecast assumptions.

### High Impact / Medium Effort (Do Next)
1. Build launch playbook with named owners and timeline.
2. Implement standardized experiment scorecard across growth channels.
3. Formalize referral mechanics and anti-abuse rules.
4. Add retention health scoring for Pro/Venue channels.
5. Establish KPI review cadence with “scale/hold/kill” decision gates.

### High Impact / High Effort (Gate Carefully)
1. Expand multi-segment pricing architecture beyond core wedding lane.
2. Build app/social layer beyond MVP retention validation.
3. Scale venue/festival channels before wedding funnel economics stabilize.

### Medium Impact / Low Effort
1. Add “deprecated assumptions” sections to docs with stale numbers.
2. Add a short glossary to unify terms (guest, uploader, participant, event owner).
3. Add one-page strategic map linking all docs to the same operating model.

### Medium Impact / Medium Effort
1. Create channel-level ROI tracker with CAC/payback comparison.
2. Add monthly assumptions reforecast process.
3. Add narrative QA step before any public-facing messaging release.

### Low Impact / High Effort (Defer)
1. Expanded visionary narrative collateral not tied to next-quarter execution.
2. Non-critical framework expansion before existing loops are measured and stable.

## Confidence Map for Key Strategy Claims

Not all claims in the strategy set have equal evidence quality. This map clarifies what is strong vs speculative.

| Claim Type | Current Confidence | Why | Recommended Upgrade Path |
|---|---|---|---|
| Wedding pain point (“photos fragmented across guests”) | **High** | Broadly observable user reality and consistent with market behavior | Keep as core anchor; collect testimonial evidence to strengthen copy |
| “No app required” as conversion advantage | **High** | Frictionless participation is a clear behavioral advantage | Quantify with funnel step completion benchmarks |
| $2/guest perceived affordability framing | **Medium-High** | Strong qualitative positioning, but elasticity still untested at scale | Run pricing sensitivity and checkout conversion tests |
| Pro channel adoption at meaningful scale | **Medium** | Model is strong, but operational assumptions are still hypothetical | Pilot with small Pro cohort and track activation-to-repeat rate |
| Guest flywheel as low-CAC engine | **Medium** | Strategically sound but highly dependent on compliance + execution quality | Instrument capture/opt-in/convert metrics and review monthly |
| Venue recurring revenue expansion | **Low-Medium** | Attractive thesis, limited evidence of willingness-to-pay and retention | Interview + pilot with venues before broad GTM messaging |
| Festival/multi-day segment viability | **Low** | Pricing and feature assumptions are unvalidated for enterprise buyers | Treat as discovery lane, not near-term revenue pillar |
| Social app expansion as growth multiplier | **Low-Medium** | Compelling vision but dependent on retention and install behavior | Gate by hard product metrics before major investment |

### Practical rule
Any claim at **Low** or **Low-Medium** confidence should be framed internally as a hypothesis, not a strategy commitment.

## Minimum Metrics Pack Needed Before Scaling

Before scaling paid channels or expanding segments, establish a minimum shared metric pack:

1. **Acquisition**
   - Visitor → signup conversion rate
   - Signup → event creation conversion rate

2. **Monetization**
   - Event creation → paid conversion rate
   - Revenue per event by segment

3. **Engagement**
   - Upload participation rate (invited vs uploaded)
   - Median uploads per event

4. **Flywheel**
   - Guest email capture rate
   - Guest marketing opt-in rate
   - Guest → creator conversion rate (cohort-based)

5. **Channel Efficiency**
   - CAC by channel
   - Payback period by channel

If these metrics are not available and reviewed consistently, strategic expansion decisions should be paused.

---

## Single-Page Strategy Narrative Template (Recommended Replacement for Drift)

Use this as the canonical one-page narrative to align all future docs:

1. **Who we win with first (ICP):**  
   _Primary buyer + immediate adjacent buyer._

2. **Core promise:**  
   _One sentence that survives all channels._

3. **Why now:**  
   _Market timing and behavioral trigger._

4. **Proof pillars (max 3):**  
   _Operational proof points, not aspirational claims._

5. **Monetization truth:**  
   _Current live pricing model + explicit exclusions._

6. **Primary growth loop:**  
   _One loop selected for this quarter._

7. **Top 3 operating priorities (90 days):**  
   _Each with owner + metric._

8. **What we are intentionally not doing:**  
   _Prevents narrative creep and focus dilution._

If any long-form strategy doc conflicts with this one-page narrative, the one-page narrative wins.

---

## Board Reporting Format (Monthly)

To keep leadership aligned, use one fixed monthly strategic readout structure:

| Section | Required Output |
|---|---|
| Strategic Focus | What remained in focus vs what was consciously deprioritized |
| KPI Movement | Top-line funnel and unit economics deltas (MoM) |
| Experiment Outcomes | Scaled / iterated / killed tests with reasons |
| Risk Register | Top 5 current strategic risks + mitigation owner |
| Assumption Changes | Which prior assumptions were invalidated or strengthened |
| Decision Requests | Clear decisions needed from leadership |

This format prevents “activity updates” from replacing strategic decision-making.

---

## Appendix A — Contradiction Reconciliation Backlog (Track to Closure)

Use this table as an execution checklist and close each row with a date + owner.

| ID | Contradiction | Where It Appears | Target Resolution | Owner Role | Due Window |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Appendix B — Quarter-1 Experiment Portfolio (Suggested)

To avoid diffusion, run a constrained test portfolio with explicit pass/fail gates.

| Experiment | Channel | Goal | Primary Metric | Pass Threshold | Stop-Loss |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| E-01 DJ Script Insertion Pilot | Partner referral | Increase in-event upload participation | Upload participation rate | +15% vs control events | <5% lift after 20 events |
| E-02 Photographer “Second Shooter” Pilot | Pro channel | Validate Pro-led activation | Pro-referred paid events / month | 10+ paid events from first cohort | <3 events after 6 weeks |
| E-03 Table Card Branding Test | Organic at-event | Brand recall + direct traffic | Branded direct visits post-event | +20% branded traffic in pilot cohort | No measurable lift after 30 events |
| E-04 Guest Flywheel Nurture Test | Lifecycle email | Guest→creator conversion | Guest-to-creator conversion rate | ≥1.5% within cohort window | <0.7% with healthy email delivery |
| E-05 Pricing Page Clarity Test | Conversion | Reduce pricing confusion | Checkout start rate | +10% checkout starts | No change after 2,000 sessions |
| E-06 Referral Incentive A/B | Referral loop | Improve referral-driven paid events | Referral-paid conversion rate | +20% vs baseline incentive | Incentive cost > contribution margin |
| E-07 Wedding Proof Content Sprint | Organic social | Improve top-of-funnel quality | Qualified signup rate from social | +25% qualified signup rate | Flat signups + low engagement for 4 weeks |
| E-08 Planner Outreach Sequence | B2B partner | Validate planner channel viability | Meetings→active planner conversion | 20% conversion to active referral | <8% after two outreach cycles |

### Portfolio guardrail
Run no more than **5 concurrent experiments** at any time; kill or graduate before opening new slots.

## Final Verdict

You have stronger strategic thinking than most early-stage teams. The opportunity now is not “more ideas” — it’s **strategic compression and consistency discipline**.

If you clean up numeric contradictions, narrow the near-term narrative, and operationalize compliance + experimentation rigor, this becomes an investable, executable marketing system rather than a collection of strong-but-parallel strategic threads.
