# Alignment Artifacts Index

This index maps each alignment artifact to its purpose so the team can execute in sequence without confusion.

## Core Sequence (Use in This Order)

1. **`ALIGNMENT-START-HERE.md`**  
   - Entry point and minimum alignment exit criteria.

2. **`MARKETING-DOCS-REVIEW.md`**  
   - Strategic critique, risks, prioritization, and recommendations.

3. **`QUESTIONS-THAT-NEED-ANSWERS.md`**  
   - Priority 0/1/2 decision questions plus decision log framework.

4. **`ALIGNMENT-DECISION-CALENDAR.md`**  
   - 30-day decision schedule to close blockers quickly.

5. **`PATH-ALIGNMENT-WORKSHEET.md`**  
   - Convert decisions into one 90-day execution path.

6. **`ALIGNMENT-CHECKLIST.md`**  
   - Final gate to confirm true alignment readiness.

## Strategy Source Inputs (Reviewed Marketing Docs)

These are source strategy documents reviewed and translated into the alignment system.  
They are not operating controls, but they remain important context inputs.

- `MARKETING-PLAN.md`
- `PRICING-MODELS.md`
- `PRO-ACCOUNT-DEEP-DIVE.md`
- `ACCOUNT-TYPES.md`
- `PURPLE-COW-CHANNELS.md`
- `NAMING-BRAINSTORM.md`
- `SOCIAL-APP-EXPLORATION.md`
- `WHATS-MISSING.md`

When conflicts appear between source inputs and active alignment artifacts, route through:
1. `ALIGNMENT-CONTRADICTION-REGISTER.md`
2. `ALIGNMENT-CANONICAL-SOURCE-MAP.md`
3. `ALIGNMENT-DECISIONS-LOG.md`

## Minimal Packs by Team Maturity

If you do not want to run the full system on day one, start with the pack that matches your current maturity:

### Pack A — Minimum Viable Alignment (small team, immediate focus)
1. `ALIGNMENT-START-HERE.md`
2. `QUESTIONS-THAT-NEED-ANSWERS.md`
3. `ALIGNMENT-PRIORITY0-DECISION-BRIEF.md`
4. `PATH-ALIGNMENT-WORKSHEET.md`
5. `ALIGNMENT-DECISIONS-LOG.md`

### Pack B — Operating Alignment (team in active execution)
Includes Pack A, plus:
6. `ALIGNMENT-DASHBOARD-TEMPLATE.md`
7. `ALIGNMENT-SCORECARD.md`
8. `ALIGNMENT-MEETING-CADENCE.md`
9. `ALIGNMENT-BLOCKERS-LOG.md`
10. `ALIGNMENT-METRIC-DEFINITIONS.md`
11. `ALIGNMENT-EXPERIMENT-REGISTRY.md`

### Pack C — Full Governance Alignment (scaling team)
Includes Pack B, plus:
12. `ALIGNMENT-GOVERNANCE-CHARTER.md`
13. `ALIGNMENT-ARTIFACT-LIFECYCLE.md`
14. `ALIGNMENT-CHANGELOG.md`
15. `ALIGNMENT-RISK-TAXONOMY.md`
16. `ALIGNMENT-RECOVERY-PLAYBOOK.md`
17. `ALIGNMENT-DECISION-SLA.md`
18. `ALIGNMENT-NARRATIVE-GUARDRAILS.md`
19. `ALIGNMENT-CONTRADICTION-REGISTER.md`

### Pack D — Advanced Diagnostics & Control (high-complexity operations)
Includes Pack C, plus:
20. `ALIGNMENT-TRACEABILITY-MATRIX.md`
21. `ALIGNMENT-ASSUMPTION-REGISTRY.md`
22. `ALIGNMENT-DEPENDENCY-TRACKER.md`
23. `ALIGNMENT-DECISION-REVERSAL-PROTOCOL.md`
24. `ALIGNMENT-EVIDENCE-STANDARDS.md`
25. `ALIGNMENT-DOC-QUALITY-SCORECARD.md`
26. `ALIGNMENT-ARTIFACT-PRUNING-POLICY.md`
27. `ALIGNMENT-STATE-MACHINE.md`
28. `ALIGNMENT-WEEKLY-EXECUTIVE-PACKET.md`
29. `ALIGNMENT-ID-STANDARDS.md`
30. `ALIGNMENT-ACTIVE-ARTIFACT-SET.md`
31. `ALIGNMENT-CANONICAL-SOURCE-MAP.md`
32. `ALIGNMENT-OPERATING-MODES.md`
33. `ALIGNMENT-SYSTEM-HEALTH-METRICS.md`
34. `ALIGNMENT-QUARTER-RESET-PROTOCOL.md`
35. `ALIGNMENT-ADOPTION-ROADMAP.md`
36. `ALIGNMENT-ONCALL-ESCALATION-MATRIX.md`
37. `ALIGNMENT-WORKING-AGREEMENTS.md`
38. `ALIGNMENT-CHANGE-IMPACT-ASSESSMENT.md`
39. `ALIGNMENT-DATA-SOURCE-CATALOG.md`

Recommended only when:
- decision volume is high,
- multiple teams own execution simultaneously,
- repeated KPI surprises require deeper causal tracing.

### Pack Activation Guardrails

| Pack | Recommended Max Active Artifacts (weekly) | Typical Team Stage |
|---|---:|---|
| Pack A | 5–7 | Early focus / founder-led execution |
| Pack B | 8–12 | Active growth and weekly operations |
| Pack C | 12–18 | Scaling with governance requirements |
| Pack D | 18+ | Multi-team complexity and high decision churn |

If your team cannot keep artifacts updated within 48 hours, drop down one pack immediately.

Rule of thumb: run the **lightest pack** that still prevents repeated drift.

---

## Success Condition

These artifacts are working when:

- Priority 0 decisions are closed,
- one path is selected and signed,
- contradictions across strategy docs are resolved,
- weekly KPI and decision cadence is running.
