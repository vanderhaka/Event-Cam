## Strategy Source Inputs (Reviewed Marketing Docs)

These are source strategy documents reviewed and translated into the alignment system.  
They are not operating controls, but they remain important context inputs.

- `MARKETING-PLAN.md`
- `PRICING-MODELS.md`
- `PRO-ACCOUNT-DEEP-DIVE.md`
- `ACCOUNT-TYPES.md`
- `PURPLE-COW-CHANNELS.md`
- `NAMING-BRAINSTORM.md`
- `SOCIAL-APP-EXPLORATION.md`

When conflicts appear between source inputs and active alignment artifacts, route through:
1. `ALIGNMENT-CONTRADICTION-REGISTER.md`
2. `ALIGNMENT-CANONICAL-SOURCE-MAP.md`

Recommended only when:
- decision volume is high,
- multiple teams own execution simultaneously,
- repeated KPI surprises require deeper causal tracing.

### Pack Activation Guardrails

| Pack | Recommended Max Active Artifacts (weekly) | Typical Team Stage |
|---|---:|---|
| Pack A | 5–7 | Early focus / founder-led execution |
| Pack B | 8–12 | Active growth and weekly operations |
| Pack C | 12–18 | Scaling with governance requirements |
| Pack D | 18+ | Multi-team complexity and high decision churn |

If your team cannot keep artifacts updated within 48 hours, drop down one pack immediately.

Rule of thumb: run the **lightest pack** that still prevents repeated drift.

---

## Success Condition

These artifacts are working when:

- Priority 0 decisions are closed,
- one path is selected and signed,
- contradictions across strategy docs are resolved,
- weekly KPI and decision cadence is running.
