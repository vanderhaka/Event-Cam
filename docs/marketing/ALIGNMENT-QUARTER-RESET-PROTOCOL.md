# Alignment Quarter Reset Protocol

Use this protocol at the end of each quarter to close the current cycle cleanly and start the next one with explicit alignment.

Without a reset ritual, teams carry unresolved contradictions, stale assumptions, and silent scope creep into the next quarter.

---

## Purpose

This protocol ensures every quarter transition includes:
- decision closure hygiene,
- signal-based learning capture,
- artifact pruning and reactivation choices,
- fresh path commitment for the next 90 days.

---

## Reset Timing

Run in two stages:

1. **T-10 to T-3 days (Pre-close prep)**
2. **T+1 to T+5 days (New-quarter activation)**

Where **T** = last day of current quarter.

---

## Stage 1 — Pre-Close Prep (T-10 to T-3)

### Step 1: Decision Closeout
- Confirm all P0 decisions are either:
  - closed,
  - explicitly deferred with owner/date,
  - escalated with forced deadline.

### Step 2: Contradiction and Blocker Sweep
- Review unresolved High/Critical contradictions.
- Review overdue blockers/dependencies.
- Determine carry-forward vs forced closure.

### Step 3: Evidence and Assumption Audit
- Re-score top assumptions (supported/rejected/superseded).
- Flag weak-evidence decisions for re-evaluation next quarter.

### Step 4: Artifact Quality Review
- Run doc quality scorecard on active set.
- Flag weak docs for repair, merge, or freeze.

---

## Stage 2 — New Quarter Activation (T+1 to T+5)

### Step 1: Set Next-Quarter Path
- Publish one primary path in `PATH-ALIGNMENT-WORKSHEET.md`.
- Publish explicit out-of-scope list.

### Step 2: Re-declare Operating Controls
- Select active pack + operating mode.
- Publish `ALIGNMENT-ACTIVE-ARTIFACT-SET.md`.
- Confirm canonical source map ownership.

### Step 3: KPI and Threshold Reset
- Confirm core KPI definitions and thresholds are still valid.
- Update success/failure thresholds where market reality changed.

### Step 4: Commit Week-1 Execution
- Publish top 3 commitments for first 7 days.
- Assign owner + success signal per commitment.

## Quarter Reset Checklist

- [ ] Quarterly retrospective completed.
- [ ] Readiness assessment completed.
- [ ] Active set republished.
- [ ] Canonical source conflicts resolved or escalated.
- [ ] Open contradiction backlog re-baselined.
- [ ] Decision SLA targets reviewed for realism.
- [ ] Operating mode selected and logged.
- [ ] Week-1 commitments published.

Quarter reset is incomplete until all boxes are checked.

---

## Carry-Forward Rules

Carry an item into next quarter only if:
- owner is explicitly confirmed,
- due date is within first 3 weeks,
- item is materially linked to selected path.

If not, either:
- close as out-of-scope,
- archive for later reconsideration.

---

## Anti-Drift Rules for New Quarter

1. No new strategic initiative in week 1 unless one legacy initiative is closed.
2. No pricing narrative changes without contradiction register and decision-log updates.
3. No channel scaling if KPI ownership or thresholds are unresolved.
4. No artifact additions without active-set classification.
