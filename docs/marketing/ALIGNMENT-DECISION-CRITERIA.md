# Alignment Decision Criteria

> Use this when comparing strategic options (especially Priority 0 decisions).

---

## Weighted Criteria Model

Score each option from 1–5 for each criterion, then multiply by weight.

| Criterion | Weight | Why It Matters |
|---|---:|---|
| Strategic focus fit | 25% | Reinforces single-path discipline |
| Commercial coherence | 20% | Avoids pricing/economics contradictions |
| Execution feasibility (90-day) | 20% | Prevents strategy from outrunning capacity |
| Measurement clarity | 15% | Enables objective scale/hold/kill decisions |
| Compliance/risk profile | 10% | Reduces legal and operational downside |
| Reversibility | 10% | Allows safe iteration if assumptions fail |

Total weight = 100%

## Option Scoring Sheet

| Option | Focus Fit (25) | Commercial (20) | Feasibility (20) | Measurement (15) | Risk (10) | Reversibility (10) | Total (/500) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| A |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| B |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| C |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

> Formula: score (1–5) × weight points, summed across criteria.

## Tie-Break Rules

If top options are within 5% of each other:

1. Prefer higher **strategic focus fit**.
2. If still tied, prefer higher **execution feasibility**.
3. If still tied, prefer lower **compliance/risk profile**.

## Decision Quality Notes

For the chosen option, capture:

- What assumptions must be true
- What would invalidate this choice
- What KPI movement is expected in 30 days
- Which docs must update within 48 hours

This should be logged in:
- `ALIGNMENT-PRIORITY0-DECISION-BRIEF.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-DECISIONS-LOG.md`
