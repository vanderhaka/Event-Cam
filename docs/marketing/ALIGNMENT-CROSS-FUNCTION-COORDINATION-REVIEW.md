# Alignment Cross-Function Coordination Review

Use this artifact to evaluate how effectively teams coordinate across decision, execution, data, and governance dependencies.

Poor cross-function coordination creates hidden delays, duplicated work, and avoidable escalation churn.

---

## Purpose

This review ensures:
- cross-team dependencies are synchronized before deadlines,
- handoffs and commitments are aligned across functions,
- coordination failure patterns are identified and corrected early.

---

## Scope

Review coordination quality across:
- strategy, growth, product, and operations,
- data/analytics and decision-owner workflows,
- incident/escalation and corrective-action collaboration,
- monthly and quarterly cross-functional review rituals.

## Coordination Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|---|---|---:|
| Cross-Dependency On-Time Rate | % cross-team dependencies delivered by agreed date | ≥ 85% |
| Coordination Delay Count | Number of delays primarily caused by cross-function misalignment | declining trend |
| Joint-Action Completion Rate | % multi-owner commitments completed on time | ≥ 80% |
| Rework-from-Misalignment Rate | % outputs reworked due to coordination gaps | ≤ 15% |
| Cross-Function Escalation Recurrence | Repeated escalations involving same function pair in 30 days | declining trend |

---

## Coordination Status Model

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Healthy | Coordination signals stable and low-friction |
| Watch | Delays/rework rising in specific function pairs |
| At Risk | Repeated cross-function failures affecting commitments |
| Recovery | Structured coordination correction in progress |

## Canonical Coordination Table

| Cycle | Function Pair | Shared Deliverable/Dependency | Due Date | Actual Date | Coordination Result (On Time/Delayed/Reworked) | Root Cause | Owner Pair | Follow-up Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [YYYY-MM-DD] |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| [YYYY-MM-DD] |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| [YYYY-MM-DD] |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Review Quality Gate

Before closing coordination review:
- [ ] all cross-functional high-priority dependencies are represented,
- [ ] delayed/reworked items have explicit cause tags,
- [ ] recurring failure pairs have named corrective owners,
- [ ] action plans include measurable next-cycle targets,
- [ ] unresolved coordination risks are escalated with due dates.

If any item is unchecked, review is incomplete.

## Coordination Correction Playbook

When status is At Risk:
1. reduce concurrent cross-team commitments to essential items,
2. create explicit owner-pair contracts for critical dependencies,
3. set shared checkpoint cadence for at-risk function pairs,
4. route repeated pair-level failures to leadership mediation.

---

## Escalation Triggers

Escalate when:
- same function pair causes 3+ delays/reworks in one cycle,
- cross-function coordination delays block P0/P1 path commitments,
- joint-action completion rate drops below 60%,
- coordination status remains At Risk for 2 consecutive cycles.

Escalation output must include:
- dominant coordination-failure pattern,
- owner-pair accountability reset,
- next-cycle coordination recovery targets.
