# Alignment Governance Charter

> Charter for how strategic alignment is governed, enforced, and adapted.

---

## Purpose

Establish a lightweight but enforceable governance model so strategy decisions remain:

- clear,
- owned,
- measurable,
- auditable.

---

## Governance Principles

1. **One path at a time** — avoid parallel primary strategies.
2. **Decision before execution** — unresolved Priority 0 items block expansion.
3. **Ownership over consensus theater** — every critical decision has one accountable owner.
4. **Evidence over intuition drift** — scale/hold/kill decisions require metric context.
5. **Transparency over memory** — decisions and changes must be logged.

---

## Decision Authority

Decision authority follows `ALIGNMENT-RACI.md`.

Any deviation from RACI must be:

1. documented in `ALIGNMENT-DECISIONS-LOG.md`,
2. communicated in the next decision review,
3. reflected in artifact ownership references if persistent.

---

## Governance Cadence

| Governance Motion | Cadence | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Decision review | Weekly | Closed decisions + escalations |
| KPI/score review | Weekly | Updated dashboard + alignment score |
| Strategy sync | Monthly | Path integrity confirmation |
| Retrospective | Quarterly | Keep/stop/start decisions for next period |

---

## Policy Controls

The following are mandatory controls:

- No unresolved Priority 0 decisions during expansion.
- No more than 5 concurrent experiments.
- 48-hour doc sync SLA for closed decisions.
- Explicit superseded trail for reversed decisions.
- Blocker severity + SLA assignment for active blockers.

---

## Non-Compliance Handling

If governance controls are repeatedly violated:

1. Trigger `ALIGNMENT-RECOVERY-PLAYBOOK.md` (Level 2 or 3 as applicable).
2. Freeze new initiatives until controls are restored.
3. Require leadership sign-off before unfreezing.

---

## Charter Review

Review this charter:

- monthly during rapid change periods,
- quarterly once operating rhythm stabilizes.

Update the changelog whenever charter policies materially change.
