# Alignment Adoption Roadmap

Use this roadmap to roll out the alignment system in manageable stages without overwhelming the team.

This is a practical implementation schedule—not a strategy document.

---

## Purpose

This roadmap helps teams:
- sequence adoption of artifacts by value and complexity,
- avoid launching too many governance controls at once,
- build operating discipline incrementally.

---

## Adoption Philosophy

Adopt in layers:
1. **Clarity Layer** — what path are we on?
2. **Control Layer** — are decisions and risks managed?
3. **Diagnostics Layer** — can we explain outcomes and debug drift?

Do not skip layers unless a crisis requires immediate diagnostic depth.

## 6-Week Adoption Plan

### Week 1 — Foundation Lock

Objectives:
- close core path decisions,
- establish one execution narrative.

Activate:
- `ALIGNMENT-START-HERE.md`
- `QUESTIONS-THAT-NEED-ANSWERS.md`
- `PATH-ALIGNMENT-WORKSHEET.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-DECISIONS-LOG.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-CHECKLIST.md`

Success signals:
- P0 decisions closed,
- one path selected,
- clear out-of-scope list published.

---

### Week 2 — Weekly Operating Rhythm

Objectives:
- start consistent weekly control behavior.

Activate:
- `ALIGNMENT-MEETING-CADENCE.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-DASHBOARD-TEMPLATE.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-SCORECARD.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-COMMAND-CENTER.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-WEEKLY-EXECUTIVE-PACKET.md`

Success signals:
- first full weekly packet published,
- weekly commitments tracked to completion.

---

### Week 3 — Decision and Risk Controls

Objectives:
- reduce decision lag and unresolved risk accumulation.

Activate:
- `ALIGNMENT-DECISION-SLA.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-BLOCKERS-LOG.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-RISK-TAXONOMY.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-DEPENDENCY-TRACKER.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-CONTRADICTION-REGISTER.md`

Success signals:
- decision SLA reporting live,
- blocker/contradiction queues have owners and due dates.

---

### Week 4 — Experiment and Evidence Discipline

Objectives:
- ensure changes are evidence-backed.

Activate:
- `ALIGNMENT-EXPERIMENT-REGISTRY.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-ASSUMPTION-REGISTRY.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-EVIDENCE-STANDARDS.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-TRACEABILITY-MATRIX.md`

Success signals:
- experiment decisions tied to thresholds,
- assumptions linked to tests and decision IDs.

---

### Week 5 — Governance and Quality Hardening

Objectives:
- make the system maintainable as artifact volume grows.

Activate:
- `ALIGNMENT-ARTIFACT-LIFECYCLE.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-DOC-QUALITY-SCORECARD.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-ARTIFACT-PRUNING-POLICY.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-ID-STANDARDS.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-STATE-MACHINE.md`

Success signals:
- active/frozen artifact set declared,
- first quality/pruning review completed.

---

### Week 6 — Scale and Reset Readiness

Objectives:
- prepare for sustained operation and quarter transitions.

Activate:
- `ALIGNMENT-OPERATING-MODES.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-ACTIVE-ARTIFACT-SET.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-CANONICAL-SOURCE-MAP.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-SYSTEM-HEALTH-METRICS.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-QUARTER-RESET-PROTOCOL.md`

Success signals:
- operating mode declared,
- system-health metrics tracked,
- quarter reset checklist dry-run complete.

---

## Adoption Exit Criteria

The roadmap is complete when:
- weekly packet cadence has run for 3+ consecutive weeks,
- decision and blocker SLA compliance is visible,
- active artifact set is stable and current,
- system-health band is not Red for two consecutive weeks.

---

## Common Adoption Failure Modes

1. **Too many artifacts activated in week 1**
   - Fix: return to roadmap stage and freeze non-essential docs.

2. **No owner assigned to newly activated controls**
   - Fix: block activation until ownership is explicit.

3. **Artifacts activated but never used in meetings**
   - Fix: deactivate and reclassify as frozen.

4. **Control debt accumulates silently**
   - Fix: use system-health metrics and quality scorecard weekly.

---

## Integration Points

Use with:
- `ALIGNMENT-START-HERE.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-ARTIFACTS-INDEX.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-ACTIVE-ARTIFACT-SET.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-COMMAND-CENTER.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-CHANGELOG.md`
