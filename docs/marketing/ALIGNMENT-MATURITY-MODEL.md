# Alignment Maturity Model

> Use this model to assess how mature your strategic alignment operating system is over time.

---

## Level 1 — Ad Hoc

**Symptoms**
- Decisions are verbal and undocumented.
- Multiple conflicting priorities are active.
- Metrics are discussed inconsistently.

**Risks**
- High rework, low accountability, rapid drift.

**Minimum move to Level 2**
- Start decision log,
- define Priority 0 questions,
- assign decision owners.

---

## Level 2 — Structured

**Symptoms**
- Priority decisions are documented.
- Basic cadence exists (some weekly reviews).
- Core artifact set exists but is inconsistently used.

**Risks**
- Process depends on a few people; fragile under stress.

**Minimum move to Level 3**
- Run recurring cadence reliably,
- standardize KPI definitions,
- enforce doc sync SLA.

---

## Level 3 — Operational

**Symptoms**
- One primary path is actively managed.
- Weekly dashboard and scorecard are used.
- Decisions, docs, and metrics are mostly synchronized.

**Risks**
- Medium risk of drift during rapid growth or major pivots.

**Minimum move to Level 4**
- Add blocker escalation discipline,
- strengthen ownership model (RACI),
- enforce experiment portfolio constraints.

---

## Level 4 — Integrated

**Symptoms**
- Alignment system is embedded in weekly operations.
- Changes are auditable via changelog and decision trail.
- Leadership decisions are consistently evidence-based.

**Risks**
- Bureaucracy creep if process becomes too heavy.

**Minimum move to Level 5**
- Optimize for speed + rigor balance,
- continuously prune low-value process steps,
- automate recurring reporting where possible.

---

## Level 5 — Adaptive

**Symptoms**
- Team can re-align quickly under changing conditions.
- Decision quality remains high even during pivots.
- Strategy changes are deliberate, measured, and reversible.

**Strength**
- High execution velocity with low strategic chaos.

## Maturity Self-Check (Quarterly)

Rate each statement 1–5:

1. We maintain one clear primary path at a time. [  ]
2. Priority decisions close with owner/date/docs synced. [  ]
3. KPI language and formulas are consistent across teams. [  ]
4. Weekly cadence yields real scale/hold/kill decisions. [  ]
5. Blockers are escalated by SLA, not by urgency theater. [  ]
6. Decision reversals are transparent and evidence-backed. [  ]
7. Alignment artifacts are actively used, not just stored. [  ]
8. We can pivot without losing decision memory. [  ]

### Interpretation
- **32–40:** Level 5 (Adaptive)
- **24–31:** Level 4 (Integrated)
- **16–23:** Level 3 (Operational)
- **8–15:** Level 2 (Structured)
- **<8:** Level 1 (Ad Hoc)
