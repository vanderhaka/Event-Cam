# Alignment Working Agreements

Use these agreements to define how the team behaves while running the alignment system.

Tools and templates fail when day-to-day team behavior is inconsistent.

---

## Purpose

This artifact sets explicit behavioral norms for:
- decision-making quality,
- communication discipline,
- accountability and ownership,
- conflict resolution speed.

---

## Core Agreements

### 1) One Path, Publicly
We operate one primary path per quarter.  
Alternative ideas are welcome, but they are treated as experiments or future options until formally selected.

### 2) Decisions Are Written, Not Implied
No major decision is considered valid until it appears in:
- `ALIGNMENT-DECISIONS-LOG.md`
- and, when relevant, `ALIGNMENT-PRIORITY0-DECISION-BRIEF.md`.

### 3) Owner + Date Required
No action item is accepted without:
- one accountable owner,
- one due date,
- one success signal.

### 4) Contradictions Are Actionable, Not Debatable
When contradiction appears:
1. log it,
2. assign owner,
3. resolve by SLA.

Long debate without logging is considered process failure.

### 5) Evidence Before Confidence
Claims that drive execution changes must be tied to explicit evidence tier.  
“Feels right” can start a hypothesis, not close a decision.

### 6) Escalate Fast, Not Late
When SLA breach is likely, escalate before deadline expiry.

### 7) Close the Loop
Every closed decision/experiment includes:
- observed outcome,
- what changed operationally,
- whether follow-up is required.

## Meeting Behavior Agreements

### Weekly KPI Standup
- Focus on signal interpretation, not narrative spin.
- No metric discussion without source/definition alignment.

### Decision Review
- Open with overdue and blocked items.
- End with explicit close/defer/escalate outcomes.

### Experiment Review
- Every running experiment has pass/stop logic.
- Inconclusive outcomes must still produce a next action.

### Strategy Sync
- Reconfirm one path and out-of-scope list.
- Resolve strategic drift before discussing new initiatives.

## Communication Agreements

1. Use canonical IDs in all written updates.
2. Reference artifacts by filename when escalating issues.
3. Summaries should distinguish:
   - facts,
   - interpretation,
   - decision request.
4. Avoid “drive-by” decision changes outside logged process.

---

## Accountability Agreements

- Owners are accountable for status freshness, not just task intent.
- Backup owner must be named for critical workflows.
- Repeated missed ownership commitments trigger role-level escalation.

---

## Conflict Resolution Agreements

When cross-functional disagreement persists:

1. restate disagreement in one sentence,
2. define decision criterion to resolve it,
3. assign decision owner and close date,
4. log outcome and rationale.

No unresolved strategic disagreement should remain open beyond one full weekly cycle.

---

## Anti-Patterns (Disallowed)

- Unowned “we should do X” actions
- Silent scope expansion without decision update
- Multiple conflicting KPI definitions in use
- Ad-hoc process exceptions without changelog entry
- Reopening resolved decisions without evidence trigger

---

## Agreement Review Cadence

- Quick check: weekly in decision review.
- Full review: monthly strategy sync.
- Reconfirm or revise agreements: quarterly reset.

Any change to these agreements must be logged in `ALIGNMENT-CHANGELOG.md`.
