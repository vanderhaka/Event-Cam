## Day 0: Preparation

1. Read `ALIGNMENT-START-HERE.md`.
2. Confirm decision authority using `ALIGNMENT-RACI.md`.
3. Open `ALIGNMENT-ARTIFACTS-INDEX.md` for full map.

Output:
- known owners,
- known decision authority,
- known artifact sequence.

Checklist:
- Close primary market decision.
- Close canonical pricing decision.
- Close Pro economics decision.
- Close dominant growth loop decision.
- Close message architecture decision.
- Close compliance baseline decision.

Exit criteria:
- Priority 0 decisions are closed with owner/date.

## Days 8–14: Convert Decisions Into One Plan

Primary objective: convert decisions into one 90-day path.

Checklist:
- Select one path (single primary path only).
- Define top commitments (max 5) and boundaries (max 5).
- Set KPI targets with owners.
- Build risk register.
- Prepare 30/60/90 checkpoints.

Exit criteria:
- one path selected,
- commitments/boundaries explicit,
- KPI contract assigned.

## Days 15–30: Start Operating Rhythm

Primary objective: turn alignment into weekly execution behavior.

Use:
- `ALIGNMENT-MEETING-CADENCE.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-DASHBOARD-TEMPLATE.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-SCORECARD.md`
- `ALIGNMENT-METRIC-DEFINITIONS.md`

Checklist:
- Run weekly KPI standup.
- Run weekly decision review.
- Run weekly experiment review.
- Publish weekly dashboard.
- Track weekly alignment score.
- Keep decision log and doc-sync SLA current.

Exit criteria:
- weekly cadence running,
- alignment score tracked,
- decision and doc updates staying synchronized.

## Days 31–60: Tighten and Prune

Primary objective: improve focus quality and remove drift.

Checklist:
- Kill or graduate low-signal experiments.
- Reconcile any remaining document contradictions.
- Enforce boundaries (“not doing this quarter”).
- Re-score alignment weekly and fix weakest categories first.

Exit criteria:
- reduced drift,
- fewer unresolved blockers,
- cleaner execution portfolio.

## Days 61–90: Evaluate and Decide Next Quarter

Primary objective: determine whether current path should continue or change.

Checklist:
- Review KPI trend vs target.
- Review decision quality (reversals, delays, sync failures).
- Review channel efficiency and payback signals.
- Decide: continue, refine, or reset path for next quarter.

Output:
- next-quarter strategic direction,
- updated path worksheet,
- documented leadership sign-off.

## Anti-Drift Rules (Always Active)

1. No new expansion initiative while Priority 0 decisions are unresolved.
2. No more than 5 concurrent experiments.
3. No “closed” decision without owner/date/doc updates.
4. No metric reinterpretation mid-quarter without logged definition change.
5. No silent reversal of strategic decisions (must use superseded decision log).
