## Measurement Rules

1. Always compare like-for-like windows (weekly vs weekly, cohort vs cohort).
2. Never change metric definitions mid-quarter without a logged decision.
3. If definition changes are required, version them and annotate impacted trend lines.
4. No channel scaling decision should be made without CAC + conversion context.
