# Alignment System README

This folder contains the alignment operating system used to keep strategy execution focused, measurable, and synchronized.

---

## What this system does

It helps teams:

1. close path-defining decisions,
2. choose one primary path,
3. run weekly execution discipline,
4. detect drift early,
5. recover quickly when alignment breaks.

---

## Quick Start

1. Read `ALIGNMENT-START-HERE.md`
2. Work through `QUESTIONS-THAT-NEED-ANSWERS.md`
3. Complete `PATH-ALIGNMENT-WORKSHEET.md`
4. Run weekly cadence via `ALIGNMENT-COMMAND-CENTER.md`
5. Declare active operating set in `ALIGNMENT-ACTIVE-ARTIFACT-SET.md`
6. Resolve source-of-truth ambiguity with `ALIGNMENT-CANONICAL-SOURCE-MAP.md`
7. Keep new decision requests controlled in `ALIGNMENT-DECISION-INTAKE-QUEUE.md`
8. If adopting gradually, follow `ALIGNMENT-ADOPTION-ROADMAP.md`

## Core Operating Sequence

- Diagnose: `MARKETING-DOCS-REVIEW.md`
- Decide: `ALIGNMENT-PRIORITY0-DECISION-BRIEF.md` + `ALIGNMENT-DECISIONS-LOG.md`
- Plan: `ALIGNMENT-DECISION-CALENDAR.md` + `PATH-ALIGNMENT-WORKSHEET.md`
- Operate: `ALIGNMENT-DASHBOARD-TEMPLATE.md` + `ALIGNMENT-SCORECARD.md`
- Govern: `ALIGNMENT-GOVERNANCE-CHARTER.md` + `ALIGNMENT-ARTIFACT-LIFECYCLE.md`
- Recover: `ALIGNMENT-RECOVERY-PLAYBOOK.md`
- Reset quarterly: `ALIGNMENT-QUARTER-RESET-PROTOCOL.md`

## Control Layer (Run Continuously)

- **Active set control:** `ALIGNMENT-ACTIVE-ARTIFACT-SET.md`
- **Mode control (process intensity):** `ALIGNMENT-OPERATING-MODES.md`
- **Canonical source control:** `ALIGNMENT-CANONICAL-SOURCE-MAP.md`
- **Data lineage control:** `ALIGNMENT-DATA-SOURCE-CATALOG.md`
- **ID and linkage hygiene:** `ALIGNMENT-ID-STANDARDS.md`
- **State transition discipline:** `ALIGNMENT-STATE-MACHINE.md`
- **Doc quality + pruning:** `ALIGNMENT-DOC-QUALITY-SCORECARD.md` + `ALIGNMENT-ARTIFACT-PRUNING-POLICY.md`
- **Team behavior baseline:** `ALIGNMENT-WORKING-AGREEMENTS.md`
- **Pre-change risk check:** `ALIGNMENT-CHANGE-IMPACT-ASSESSMENT.md`
- **Decision front-door control:** `ALIGNMENT-DECISION-INTAKE-QUEUE.md`
- **Decision concurrency control:** `ALIGNMENT-DECISION-WIP-LIMITS.md`
- **Decision impact verification:** `ALIGNMENT-DECISION-OUTCOME-REVIEWS.md`
- **Meeting yield control:** `ALIGNMENT-MEETING-EFFECTIVENESS-REVIEW.md`
- **Commitment recovery control:** `ALIGNMENT-COMMITMENT-SLIPPAGE-PROTOCOL.md`
- **Artifact usage telemetry:** `ALIGNMENT-ARTIFACT-USAGE-TELEMETRY.md`
- **Control sunset governance:** `ALIGNMENT-CONTROL-SUNSET-CRITERIA.md`
- **Decision confidence scoring:** `ALIGNMENT-DECISION-CONFIDENCE-INDEX.md`

These controls keep the system operable as artifact count grows.

## Maintenance Standard

- Keep decisions and docs synced within 48 hours.
- Keep experiment count at 5 or fewer.
- Keep one primary path active per quarter.
- Use changelog + decision log for all material changes.
- Keep only one declared active artifact set per cycle.
- If canonical-source conflicts persist >5 business days, escalate in weekly decision review.
- Keep P0 decision intake triage within 24 hours.
- Keep active decision counts within declared WIP ceilings.
- Keep decision outcome reviews current for closed P0/high-impact P1 decisions.
- Keep recurring meetings outcome-positive (no 2-week Red effectiveness streak).
- Keep S2/S3 commitment slippage on documented recovery plans within same week.
- Keep active-artifact utilization healthy and prune low-use controls quickly.
- Retire controls only through explicit sunset criteria and verification windows.
- Keep active P0/P1 decisions above minimum confidence band or on conditional mitigation plans.
