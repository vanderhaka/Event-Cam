# Alignment System README

This folder contains the alignment operating system used to keep strategy execution focused, measurable, and synchronized.

---

## What this system does

It helps teams:

1. close path-defining decisions,
2. choose one primary path,
3. run weekly execution discipline,
4. detect drift early,
5. recover quickly when alignment breaks.

---

## Quick Start

1. Read `ALIGNMENT-START-HERE.md`
2. Work through `QUESTIONS-THAT-NEED-ANSWERS.md`
3. Complete `PATH-ALIGNMENT-WORKSHEET.md`
4. Run weekly cadence via `ALIGNMENT-COMMAND-CENTER.md`
5. Declare active operating set in `ALIGNMENT-ACTIVE-ARTIFACT-SET.md`
6. Resolve source-of-truth ambiguity with `ALIGNMENT-CANONICAL-SOURCE-MAP.md`
7. Keep new decision requests controlled in `ALIGNMENT-DECISION-INTAKE-QUEUE.md`
8. If adopting gradually, follow `ALIGNMENT-ADOPTION-ROADMAP.md`

## Maintenance Standard

- Keep decisions and docs synced within 48 hours.
- Keep experiment count at 5 or fewer.
- Keep one primary path active per quarter.
- Use changelog + decision log for all material changes.
- Keep only one declared active artifact set per cycle.
- If canonical-source conflicts persist >5 business days, escalate in weekly decision review.
- Keep P0 decision intake triage within 24 hours.
- Keep active decision counts within declared WIP ceilings.
- Keep decision outcome reviews current for closed P0/high-impact P1 decisions.
- Keep recurring meetings outcome-positive (no 2-week Red effectiveness streak).
- Keep S2/S3 commitment slippage on documented recovery plans within same week.
- Keep active-artifact utilization healthy and prune low-use controls quickly.
- Retire controls only through explicit sunset criteria and verification windows.
- Keep active P0/P1 decisions above minimum confidence band or on conditional mitigation plans.
- Run monthly calibration to ensure confidence scores match observed outcomes.
- Keep evidence refresh current; expired evidence should not drive P0/P1 approvals.
- Keep all control overrides logged, time-bounded, and reviewed weekly.
- Keep governance effort within budget and reduce controls when cost outruns value.
- Run quarterly control portfolio reviews to keep active controls right-sized.
- Run monthly governance ROI checks to confirm process effort is worth the cost.
- Resolve all control conflicts through precedence rules before using overrides.
- Run C2/C3 control updates through formal change packets and verification windows.
- Prioritize automation using scorecard so build effort targets highest governance ROI first.
- Keep critical signal detection→assignment→action lag within threshold by stage.
- Contain and redesign controls quickly when high-severity failure modes recur.
- Keep escalation closures root-cause-complete and recurrence trending down.
- Keep corrective-action backlog small and verified-closure rates high.
- Keep closed statuses audit-valid with evidence-linked closure quality above threshold.
- Keep leading indicators monitored and prevent Warning/Critical drift from compounding.
- Keep preventive action patterns only when they measurably reduce downstream failures.
- Keep threshold bands calibrated to minimize missed alerts and noisy false positives.
- Keep decision quality trends stable by intervening early on regression signals.
- Keep alert volume/noise within capacity so critical warnings remain actionable.
- Keep control prerequisites visible so downstream controls run only when valid.
- Keep weekly/monthly/quarterly review cadence on schedule with complete inputs.
- Keep newly launched controls above adoption target or intervene quickly.
- Keep each active control above minimum effectiveness score or route portfolio action.
- Keep contradictory signal patterns diagnosed before high-impact decisions proceed.
- Keep exception recurrence and expired-exception counts low through policy correction.
- Keep ownership transitions complete and stable with no critical ownerless windows.
- Keep overall operating-health index stable and above recovery-trigger bands.
- Keep highest-criticality controls under strict compliance and escalation discipline.
- Keep high-impact decisions blocked from approval until packets meet required quality bar.
- Keep reopened-decision churn low by resolving root causes before reclose.
- Keep recurring root causes visible and prioritized for structural fixes.
- Keep unresolved-item aging in control through severity-weighted backlog burn-down.
- Keep chronic recurrence clusters visible and trending down by cycle.
- Keep controls moving through lifecycle stages with evidence-based transition decisions.
- Keep cross-function coordination quality high on shared dependencies and commitments.
- Keep overlapping controls clarified or merged to prevent duplicate effort and conflict.
- Keep high-impact assumptions revalidated and rebased before drift contaminates decisions.
- Keep remediation capacity focused on highest-priority interventions first.
- Keep projected owner overload low through pre-cycle capacity rebalancing.
- Keep decision-stage bottlenecks visible and shrinking cycle-over-cycle.
- Keep high-priority dependencies within SLA to prevent cascade delays.
- Keep critical data sources in reliable bands before high-confidence decisions proceed.
- Keep metric formulas and thresholds consistent across all active operating artifacts.
- Keep concurrent control changes within adoption capacity to avoid saturation failures.
- Keep recovery plans within declared windows and verify stabilization before closure.
- Keep source references aligned to canonical-source map to avoid contradiction reintroduction.
- Keep decision outcome visibility timely enough to support reinforcement/modification/reversal decisions.
- Keep high-impact actions linked to valid, fresh evidence before closure or approval.
- Keep high-impact decisions covered by explicit reversal triggers before approval.
- Keep high-impact decisions approved only through declared authority routes.
- Keep CC-1/CC-2 controls fully covered with primary, backup, and escalation owners.
- Keep P0/high-impact closures compliant with explicit definition-of-done criteria.
- Keep CC-1/CC-2 runbooks current and validation-tested on declared cadence.
- Keep CC-1 drill quality above threshold and close drill corrective actions on time.
- Keep CC-1 failover readiness at target and remediate not-ready controls immediately.
- Keep high-blast dependencies mapped, mitigated, and containment-tested.
