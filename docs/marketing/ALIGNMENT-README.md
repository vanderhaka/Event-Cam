# Alignment System README

This folder contains the alignment operating system used to keep strategy execution focused, measurable, and synchronized.

---

## What this system does

It helps teams:

1. close path-defining decisions,
2. choose one primary path,
3. run weekly execution discipline,
4. detect drift early,
5. recover quickly when alignment breaks.

---

## Quick Start

1. Read `ALIGNMENT-START-HERE.md`
2. Work through `QUESTIONS-THAT-NEED-ANSWERS.md`
3. Complete `PATH-ALIGNMENT-WORKSHEET.md`
4. Run weekly cadence via `ALIGNMENT-COMMAND-CENTER.md`

---

## Core Operating Sequence

- Diagnose: `MARKETING-DOCS-REVIEW.md`
- Decide: `ALIGNMENT-PRIORITY0-DECISION-BRIEF.md` + `ALIGNMENT-DECISIONS-LOG.md`
- Plan: `ALIGNMENT-DECISION-CALENDAR.md` + `PATH-ALIGNMENT-WORKSHEET.md`
- Operate: `ALIGNMENT-DASHBOARD-TEMPLATE.md` + `ALIGNMENT-SCORECARD.md`
- Govern: `ALIGNMENT-GOVERNANCE-CHARTER.md` + `ALIGNMENT-ARTIFACT-LIFECYCLE.md`
- Recover: `ALIGNMENT-RECOVERY-PLAYBOOK.md`

---

## Artifact Map

For full routing by scenario, use:

`ALIGNMENT-ARTIFACTS-INDEX.md`

---

## Maintenance Standard

- Keep decisions and docs synced within 48 hours.
- Keep experiment count at 5 or fewer.
- Keep one primary path active per quarter.
- Use changelog + decision log for all material changes.
