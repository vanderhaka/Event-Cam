# Alignment Weekly Executive Packet

Use this template to prepare a single weekly packet for leadership decision review.

This packet consolidates signals from all core alignment artifacts into one decision-ready brief.

---

## Purpose

The weekly packet should answer five leadership questions:

1. Are we still on one coherent path?
2. Are KPI signals moving in the expected direction?
3. Which decisions are blocked or overdue?
4. What risks require immediate intervention?
5. What leadership decisions are required this week?

## Packet Quality Gate (Before Sending)

- [ ] All data values reflect latest weekly cut.
- [ ] Every escalation has owner + due date.
- [ ] Decision IDs match the decision log.
- [ ] Contradictions and blockers are reconciled with latest statuses.
- [ ] Leadership decisions required are explicit and time-bound.

If any item is unchecked, packet is not ready for executive review.
