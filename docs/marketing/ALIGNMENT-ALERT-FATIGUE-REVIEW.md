# Alignment Alert Fatigue Review

Use this artifact to monitor whether alert volume and quality are overwhelming teams and reducing response effectiveness.

Too many low-value alerts create desensitization, slower response, and missed critical warnings.

---

## Purpose

This review ensures:
- alert volume remains proportional to team response capacity,
- noisy alerts are reduced without hiding real risk,
- critical alerts retain urgency and action quality.

---

## Scope

Review alerts generated by:
- KPI thresholds and anomaly protocols,
- leading-indicator watchlist transitions,
- SLA and control-breach triggers,
- escalation and incident-warning flows.

## Alert Fatigue Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|---|---|---:|
| Alerts per Owner per Week | Average actionable alerts assigned per owner | within agreed capacity band |
| Low-Value Alert Rate | % alerts closed as non-actionable/no meaningful risk | ≤ 25% |
| Critical Alert Response SLA | % critical alerts acknowledged within required window | ≥ 95% |
| Repeat Alert Ratio | % alerts repeating same condition without threshold/design change | declining trend |
| Alert Ignore/Delay Rate | % alerts not acknowledged within SLA | ≤ 10% |

## Alert Fatigue Status Model

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Healthy | Alert flow is actionable and within owner capacity |
| Watch | Alert volume/noise rising; response quality at risk |
| Fatigued | High noise or overload reducing response quality |
| Recovery | Noise-reduction actions active and trending better |

## Canonical Alert Fatigue Table

| Week | Total Alerts | Critical Alerts | Low-Value Alert % | Repeat Alert % | Overdue Acknowledgments | Fatigue Status | Corrective Action |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| [YYYY-MM-DD] |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| [YYYY-MM-DD] |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Mitigation Playbook

When fatigue status is Watch/Fatigued:
1. collapse duplicate alerts from same root signal,
2. tighten routing to owner-of-record only,
3. recalibrate noisy thresholds with evidence,
4. suppress low-severity repeats during active incident windows,
5. verify critical-alert channels remain unthrottled.

---

## Quality Gate

Before declaring fatigue recovered:
- [ ] low-value alert rate returns within target,
- [ ] critical-alert SLA restored,
- [ ] repeat alerts reduced through design/threshold updates,
- [ ] owner load no longer exceeds alert capacity baseline,
- [ ] recovery actions are documented and standardized.

---

## Escalation Triggers

Escalate when:
- fatigue status remains Fatigued for 2 consecutive weeks,
- critical-alert response SLA drops below 85% in any week,
- low-value alert rate exceeds 40% for 2 weeks,
- repeat-alert ratio rises while threshold changes are not implemented.

Escalation output must include:
- top noisy alert sources,
- threshold/routing redesign owner and due date,
- expected alert-volume and SLA recovery target.
