# Alignment Automation Backlog

> Candidate automations to reduce manual governance overhead while preserving alignment rigor.

## Priority A — High Impact, Low Complexity

| Automation Idea | Outcome | Owner Role | Target Window |
|---|---|---|---|
| Auto-remind overdue Priority 0 decisions | Faster decision closure and fewer blocker escalations | Ops / PMO | 2–4 weeks |
| Auto-flag missing KPI owners in dashboard prep | Prevent ownerless metric reporting | Growth Ops | 2–4 weeks |
| Auto-check experiment count >5 | Enforce portfolio guardrail automatically | Growth Lead | 2–4 weeks |
| Auto-generate weekly scorecard shell | Reduce operational friction for cadence compliance | Ops / PMO | 1–2 weeks |

---

## Priority B — Medium Impact, Medium Complexity

| Automation Idea | Outcome | Owner Role | Target Window |
|---|---|---|---|
| Decision-log to doc-sync reminder workflow | Improve 48-hour doc sync SLA compliance | Ops / PMO | 4–6 weeks |
| KPI data-quality preflight checks | Catch data issues before decision meetings | Product Analytics | 4–8 weeks |
| Monthly review packet auto-assembly | Faster strategy sync preparation | Ops / PMO | 4–8 weeks |

## Priority C — Strategic, Higher Complexity

| Automation Idea | Outcome | Owner Role | Target Window |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unified alignment dashboard with trend alerts | Real-time drift detection | Growth + Engineering | 8–12 weeks |
| Decision-impact graph (which docs/processes affected) | Faster and safer decision propagation | Ops + Product | 8–12 weeks |
| Alignment maturity auto-scoring from artifacts | Continuous governance insight | Ops + Analytics | 10–16 weeks |

## Automation Selection Criteria

Before implementing an automation, verify:

- [ ] It removes repetitive manual work.
- [ ] It reduces alignment failure risk (not just convenience).
- [ ] It has a clear owner.
- [ ] It has success metrics.
- [ ] It does not introduce governance opacity.

## Success Metrics for Automation Program

Track monthly:

1. Priority decision closure time
2. Doc sync SLA performance
3. Meeting prep time reduction
4. Alignment score volatility
5. Number of avoidable escalations

If automation does not improve at least one of these, deprioritize it.
