# Naming & Branding Brainstorm

> "Event Cam" is functional but forgettable. It describes what the product does, not how it makes you feel. A purple cow name should be evocative, emotional, and instantly memorable — something a bride says to her engaged friend over brunch and the friend remembers it three months later.

---

## What the Name Needs to Do

- Feel **premium but accessible** — this is a wedding product, not a dev tool
- Be **one word** (ideally) or two short words — easy to say, text, and Google
- Work as a **verb** if possible — "Did you Afterglow your wedding?" (the holy grail of branding)
- Evoke **emotion** — memories, warmth, celebration, intimacy
- Not sound like a **camera app** — avoid "snap," "pic," "photo," "cam" in the name
- Be **domain-available** (or close) — .com ideal, .co or .app acceptable
- Look beautiful as a **logo** — one word, clean typography, optional icon
- Work in the sentence: "We used ______ at our wedding and got 2,000 photos from every guest"

---

## Tier 1: Top Contenders

These are the strongest names. Each has a distinct emotional angle and branding potential.

### 1. Afterglow

> The warm light that lingers after the sun sets. The feeling after an incredible experience.

- **Why it's great:** This IS the product's magic moment — the morning after the wedding, when the couple opens the app and sees hundreds of photos they've never seen before. The afterglow of the best day of their lives.
- **Sounds like:** Premium. Warm. Intimate. Slightly poetic without being pretentious.
- **As a sentence:** "We used Afterglow at our wedding." / "Afterglow collected every photo from our guests."
- **As a verb:** "Did you Afterglow your wedding?" (works)
- **Tagline pairings:**
  - "Afterglow — Every moment, from every guest."
  - "Afterglow — The album that appears the morning after."
  - "Afterglow — Your wedding, through everyone's eyes."
- **Visual brand:** Warm amber/gold tones. Soft gradients. Think golden hour photography. Logo: clean sans-serif, lowercase "afterglow" with a subtle glow effect on the 'o'.
- **Domain:** afterglow.app, getafterglow.com, useafterglow.com (afterglow.com is likely taken)
- **Risk:** Common English word — some competition in search. But with "afterglow wedding photos" you'd own it fast.

---

### 2. Confetti

> Scattered pieces of celebration, coming together in one place.

- **Why it's great:** Instant wedding association. Joyful, colorful, celebratory. And it's a perfect metaphor — confetti is many tiny pieces thrown by many people, just like guest photos. The product gathers the confetti into one album.
- **Sounds like:** Fun. Festive. Approachable. Slightly playful.
- **As a sentence:** "We used Confetti at our wedding." / "Confetti got us 2,000 guest photos."
- **As a verb:** "Confetti your wedding!" (works as a call to action)
- **Tagline pairings:**
  - "Confetti — Every guest. Every photo. One album."
  - "Confetti — Your wedding, from every angle."
  - "Confetti — Gather every moment."
- **Visual brand:** Bold, joyful colors — pinks, golds, warm whites. Confetti sprinkle motifs. Logo: rounded, friendly typeface. Maybe a single piece of confetti as the dot on the 'i'.
- **Domain:** confetti.app, getconfetti.com, withconfetti.com (confetti.com is taken — it's a UK wedding planning site, but different enough product)
- **Risk:** There's a UK wedding planning website called Confetti. Different product entirely, but could cause some brand confusion in the UK market. Very strong name otherwise.

---

### 3. Toast

> "A toast to the happy couple." Raising a glass. Celebrating together.

- **Why it's great:** Short, warm, universally understood. Every wedding has a toast. It's a moment of collective celebration — everyone facing the couple, glasses raised. That same collective energy is what Event Cam captures.
- **Sounds like:** Warm. Simple. Celebratory. Slightly cheeky.
- **As a sentence:** "We used Toast at our wedding." / "Toast collected every guest's photos."
- **As a verb:** "Toast your wedding." (natural, beautiful double meaning)
- **Tagline pairings:**
  - "Toast — Every guest. Every photo. Raise a glass."
  - "Toast — Collect every moment, from every guest."
  - "Toast — Here's to every memory."
- **Visual brand:** Warm tones — champagne gold, cream, blush. Elegant but not stuffy. Logo: clean serif or sans-serif, maybe a subtle champagne glass incorporated into the 'T'.
- **Domain:** toastweddings.com, toast.app, gettoast.com (toast.com is likely taken — there's Toast the restaurant POS system)
- **Risk:** Toast POS (restaurant point-of-sale) is a well-funded company. Different industry entirely, but the name collision is real. Would need a modifier: "Toast Weddings," "Toast Photos," or "Wedding Toast."

---

### 4. Heirloom

> A precious object passed down through generations. Something you keep forever.

- **Why it's great:** Positions the album as something timeless and valuable — not just a digital dump of photos, but a family heirloom. This is the premium play. It says: "These photos matter. They're worth keeping."
- **Sounds like:** Premium. Timeless. Emotional. Heritage.
- **As a sentence:** "We used Heirloom at our wedding." / "Heirloom collected all our guest photos."
- **As a verb:** Less natural — "Heirloom your wedding" is a stretch.
- **Tagline pairings:**
  - "Heirloom — Every memory, from every guest."
  - "Heirloom — Your wedding, kept forever."
  - "Heirloom — The album your grandchildren will treasure."
- **Visual brand:** Deep, rich colors — navy, gold, cream, forest green. Classic typography — elegant serif. Think luxury stationery meets modern tech. Logo: serif "Heirloom" with a subtle monogram icon.
- **Domain:** heirloom.app, getheirloom.com, heirloomalbum.com
- **Risk:** Feels more upscale, which could create friction with the "$1/guest" accessibility angle. Also "Heirloom" is used in food/agriculture branding (heirloom tomatoes). But in the wedding context, it's clean.

---

### 5. Mosaic

> Many small pieces forming one beautiful picture.

- **Why it's great:** Literally what the product does — 150 guests contribute small pieces (photos) that form one complete picture (the wedding album). It's metaphorically perfect. Also sounds artistic and intentional.
- **Sounds like:** Artistic. Thoughtful. Sophisticated. Slightly intellectual.
- **As a sentence:** "We used Mosaic for our wedding photos." / "Mosaic collected every angle."
- **As a verb:** "Mosaic your wedding." (a bit unusual, but works)
- **Tagline pairings:**
  - "Mosaic — Your wedding, through every lens."
  - "Mosaic — 150 guests. 2,000 photos. One story."
  - "Mosaic — Every piece matters."
- **Visual brand:** Geometric patterns, tessellations, photo grids. Modern, clean, slightly art-forward. Colors: versatile — could go bold or muted. Logo: geometric 'M' made of small squares/pieces.
- **Domain:** mosaic.app, getmosaic.com, mosaicweddings.com
- **Risk:** Common word with some competition. There are photo mosaic tools and apps already. Would need strong SEO and brand differentiation.

## Tier 2: Strong Runners-Up

Names that are good but have a specific trade-off.

### 6. Bloom

> To open up, to flourish, to come into full beauty.

- The album "blooms" with guest photos. Flowers = weddings.
- Warm, organic, feminine-leaning (which aligns with the primary buyer).
- "Your album, in full Bloom."
- **Trade-off:** Very common in startup naming. Multiple products called Bloom exist.

### 7. Reverie

> A state of dreamy, pleasant contemplation. A daydream about beautiful memories.

- Poetic, romantic, distinctive. Not many products called Reverie.
- "Reverie — Your wedding, remembered by everyone."
- Feels luxurious, like a premium brand.
- **Trade-off:** Some people won't know what it means. Hard to spell on first hearing.

### 8. Lumen

> A unit of light. The fundamental element of photography.

- Photography is literally capturing light. Lumen = light captured by every guest.
- Clean, modern, scientific-meets-beautiful.
- "Lumen — Light from every angle."
- **Trade-off:** Sounds more like a tech product than a wedding product. Amazon has a product called Lumen.

### 9. Encore

> The part of the show that comes after you think it's over.

- The wedding ends, but then... encore! Hundreds of unseen photos appear.
- "The encore to your wedding."
- Fun, theatrical, energetic.
- **Trade-off:** Strong association with concerts/theatre, which could dilute the wedding positioning.

### 10. Keepsake

> Something kept as a reminder of a person, place, or event.

- Directly describes what the album becomes. Emotional, nostalgic.
- "Keepsake — Every photo, from every guest."
- **Trade-off:** A bit passive/quiet. Doesn't have the energy of Confetti or the warmth of Afterglow.

### 11. Flashbulb

> The bright flash of a camera. Also: "flashbulb memory" — a vivid, snapshot-like memory of a significant moment.

- Perfect double meaning: camera flash + the psychological phenomenon of vivid memories.
- "Flashbulb — Your wedding, from 150 cameras."
- Retro-cool, distinctive.
- **Trade-off:** Two syllables is great, but "flash" has overloaded tech associations (Adobe Flash, Flash sales, etc.).

### 12. Tableau

> A vivid, striking scene. Also means "picture" in French.

- Sophisticated, artistic, distinctly memorable.
- "Tableau — Your wedding, from every perspective."
- **Trade-off:** Tableau Software is a massive data visualization company. Name collision is too strong.

## Tier 3: Interesting but Niche

Names that are creative but have more significant trade-offs.

| Name | Angle | Trade-off |
|------|-------|-----------|
| **Candid** | The photos are candid, unposed, real | Too generic, hard to own in search |
| **Sparkler** | Wedding sparklers, sparkling moments | Feels like a kids' product |
| **Bouquet** | Collection of beautiful things | Too floral, limits brand expansion |
| **Aisle** | Core wedding imagery | Too narrow, sounds like a wedding planning tool |
| **Gathered** | "We gathered every photo" | Passive, doesn't pop |
| **Vantage** | Every guest's unique vantage point | Sounds like a security camera company |
| **Flicker** | Fleeting moments captured | Sounds like Flickr (dead but memorable) |
| **Glow** | Warm, beautiful, simple | Too short and common; hard to own |
| **Shutter** | Camera reference, opening/closing | Feels like a stock photo site |
| **Memoir** | Personal story, keepsake | Sounds like a journaling app |

| Name | Energy | Warmth | Premium | Memorable | Verb Potential | Wedding Fit |
|------|--------|--------|---------|-----------|----------------|-------------|

## The "Say It at Brunch" Test

The ultimate test: Does the name survive the sentence a bride says to her engaged friend over brunch?

> "Oh my god, you HAVE to use **Afterglow** at your wedding. We got like 2,000 photos from our guests. It was incredible."

> "We used **Confetti** — you just put QR codes on the tables and guests scan and upload. We got photos we never would have seen."

> "Have you heard of **Toast**? It's this thing where your guests upload all their wedding photos and it puts your names on every single one. It was like a dollar per guest."

> "We did **Heirloom** for our wedding photos. Every single guest photo has our custom watermark with our names and the date. It's gorgeous."

> "You need **Mosaic** for your wedding. 150 guests, 2,000 photos, and it looks like one cohesive album."

All five Tier 1 names pass. But **Afterglow** and **Confetti** have the most natural energy in conversation. **Toast** is the easiest to remember but has the naming conflict. **Heirloom** sounds the most premium. **Mosaic** sounds the most intentional/artistic.

## Recommendation

**Go with Afterglow.**

Here's why:

1. **It captures the product's magic moment** — not the upload, not the QR scan, but the emotional peak: the morning after, when you discover 2,000 photos you've never seen. That IS the afterglow.
2. **It's warm and premium without being exclusionary** — works for a $30 intimate wedding and a $500 grand celebration equally.
3. **It's distinctive** — no major tech/wedding product owns this word. You can dominate "afterglow wedding" in search within months.
4. **It works as a verb** — "We Afterglowed our wedding" is unusual enough to be memorable.
5. **The visual brand writes itself** — warm gold, amber tones, golden hour photography. It's beautiful and cohesive from day one.
6. **It hints at the AI features without naming them** — the "glow" connects naturally to filters and warm photo processing. An "Afterglow filter" is a thing people would actually want.
7. **It ages well** — if you expand beyond weddings (parties, corporate events, concerts), "afterglow" still works. Every great event has an afterglow.

**Second choice:** Confetti, if you want a more energetic, playful brand. It's the extrovert to Afterglow's warm introvert.
