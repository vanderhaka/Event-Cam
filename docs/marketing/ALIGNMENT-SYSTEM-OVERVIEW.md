# Alignment System Overview

This document explains how all alignment artifacts work together as one operating system.

---

## Why this exists

Strategy docs often fail at execution because:
- decisions are not finalized,
- owners are unclear,
- numbers drift across documents,
- cadence breaks after week one.

The alignment system solves that by combining:
1. decision clarity,
2. ownership clarity,
3. measurement clarity,
4. operating cadence.

## System Components

| Component Type | Artifact(s) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Entry + navigation | `ALIGNMENT-START-HERE.md`, `ALIGNMENT-ARTIFACTS-INDEX.md` | Tell the team where to begin and what to use when |
| Strategic diagnosis | `MARKETING-DOCS-REVIEW.md` | Identify contradictions, risks, and priorities |
| Decision layer | `QUESTIONS-THAT-NEED-ANSWERS.md`, `ALIGNMENT-PRIORITY0-DECISION-BRIEF.md`, `ALIGNMENT-DECISIONS-LOG.md` | Close key decisions with audit trail |
| Planning layer | `ALIGNMENT-DECISION-CALENDAR.md`, `PATH-ALIGNMENT-WORKSHEET.md`, `ALIGNMENT-CHECKLIST.md` | Convert decisions into one 90-day path |
| Operating layer | `ALIGNMENT-MEETING-CADENCE.md`, `ALIGNMENT-DASHBOARD-TEMPLATE.md`, `ALIGNMENT-SCORECARD.md` | Keep weekly execution disciplined |
| Control layer | `ALIGNMENT-RACI.md`, `ALIGNMENT-METRIC-DEFINITIONS.md`, `ALIGNMENT-GLOSSARY.md`, `ALIGNMENT-FAQ.md` | Keep roles, terms, and metrics consistent |
| Time-sequenced playbook | `ALIGNMENT-RUNBOOK.md` | Guide execution from Day 0 to Day 90 |

## Minimum Viable Alignment Stack

If you need to run lean, use these five first:

1. `QUESTIONS-THAT-NEED-ANSWERS.md`
2. `ALIGNMENT-PRIORITY0-DECISION-BRIEF.md`
3. `PATH-ALIGNMENT-WORKSHEET.md`
4. `ALIGNMENT-DASHBOARD-TEMPLATE.md`
5. `ALIGNMENT-DECISIONS-LOG.md`

Everything else strengthens governance and durability.

## 15-Minute Daily Maintenance Loop

Use this lightweight daily routine to prevent drift:

1. Check if any Priority 0 item is blocked.
2. Check if any decision closed yesterday still lacks doc sync.
3. Check if any ownerless KPI or experiment exists.
4. Check whether active work violates quarter boundaries.
5. Log one sentence: “alignment stronger / weaker / unchanged” and why.

This loop keeps problems small before they become strategic resets.

## Failure Modes to Watch

- **Ownership diffusion:** too many “everyone owns it” tasks.
- **Metric drift:** same KPI interpreted differently by teams.
- **Narrative drift:** old and new messaging both active.
- **Decision amnesia:** decisions made verbally but never logged.
- **Experiment overload:** too many concurrent tests and no closeouts.

When any failure mode appears, use the scorecard + decision review cadence immediately.

## Success Signal

The system is working when weekly operations produce:

- fewer open Priority 0 decisions,
- consistent numbers across strategy docs,
- clear scale/hold/kill calls,
- and visibly tighter execution focus quarter over quarter.
