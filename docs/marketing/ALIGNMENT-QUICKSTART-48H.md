# Alignment Quickstart (First 48 Hours)

> Fast-start guide to move from strategy confusion to an aligned operating baseline in two days.

---

## Hour 0–4: Establish Control

1. Confirm decision authority using `ALIGNMENT-RACI.md`.
2. Open `QUESTIONS-THAT-NEED-ANSWERS.md` and identify all Priority 0 items.
3. Assign owner and decision due date to each Priority 0 item.

Deliverable:
- Initial decision owner map + due windows.

---

## Hour 4–12: Close Core Path Decisions

For each Priority 0 item:
1. Use `ALIGNMENT-PRIORITY0-DECISION-BRIEF.md`.
2. Select option with `ALIGNMENT-DECISION-CRITERIA.md`.
3. Record decision in `ALIGNMENT-DECISIONS-LOG.md`.

Deliverable:
- Closed or in-progress status for every Priority 0 item.

---

## Hour 12–24: Synchronize Strategic Reality

1. Reconcile contradictions in pricing/economics docs.
2. Confirm one quarterly message architecture.
3. Confirm one dominant growth loop + one support loop.

Deliverable:
- One coherent strategic baseline with no unresolved core contradictions.

---

## Hour 24–36: Lock Operating Rhythm

1. Configure weekly meetings from `ALIGNMENT-MEETING-CADENCE.md`.
2. Set KPI ownership from `ALIGNMENT-METRIC-DEFINITIONS.md`.
3. Prepare `ALIGNMENT-DASHBOARD-TEMPLATE.md` for first weekly cycle.

Deliverable:
- Recurring execution cadence scheduled and owned.

---

## Hour 36–48: Launch Path Execution

1. Complete `PATH-ALIGNMENT-WORKSHEET.md` with commitments and boundaries.
2. Verify readiness using `ALIGNMENT-CHECKLIST.md`.
3. Send aligned path announcement using `ALIGNMENT-KICKOFF-COMMS-TEMPLATE.md`.

Deliverable:
- Team-wide path confirmation and execution kickoff.

---

## 48-Hour Success Test

You are ready to execute if all are true:

- Priority 0 decisions are closed or explicitly escalated.
- One path is selected and documented.
- Weekly KPI and decision cadence is scheduled.
- Decision and documentation sync process is active.

If any condition fails, extend alignment cycle before scaling work.
