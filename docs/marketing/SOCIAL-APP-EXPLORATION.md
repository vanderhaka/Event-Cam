# The App — Personal Event Hub

> The product doesn't have to be a tool you use once. It can be the place where every event in your life lives — every wedding you attended, every party, every gig at your local pub. Private by default. Everything in one place. The more you use it, the more it becomes *your* history of celebrations. And the easiest place to create the next one.

---

## The Core Idea

Right now, the product lifecycle is linear and terminal:

```
Couple signs up → creates event → guests upload → couple moderates → 
album shared → done. Product goes dormant.
```

The relationship with the couple ends after the album is shared. The relationship with the guests ends after the album delivery email. All that content, all those users — it just stops.

**The app changes that.** It becomes the central hub for every event you go to:

```
You attend a wedding → photos appear in your app
You go to a gig at a pub → photos appear in your app
You attend a friend's birthday → photos appear in your app
You follow your local venue → see their public event photos in your feed
You decide to host your own event → one tap to create, right from the app
```

**It's not a social network. It's a personal event memory vault with a public layer for venues.**

### What Makes It Different from Instagram

| | Instagram | This App |
|---|-----------|----------|
| Content | Everything (food, selfies, ads, memes) | Only events and celebrations |
| Default privacy | Public | Private (only guests see it) |
| Why you open it | Boredom, habit, FOMO | You attended an event, or you're feeling nostalgic |
| Engagement model | Daily dopamine hits | Low frequency, high intensity — open after events, revisit memories |
| How content arrives | You create it intentionally | It appears automatically because you were there |
| Monetisation | Ads | Event creation fees ($2/guest) |
| User acquisition | Paid/organic marketing | Every event seeds 50–500 users organically |

---

## The Two Layers

### Layer 1: Private Events (Default)

Every private event (wedding, birthday, corporate event, house party) is only visible to people who were at that event. You attended → you see it in your app. Nobody else does.

**How it works:**
- You scan the QR at a wedding and upload photos
- That event now appears in your app under "Your Events"
- You see the curated album, your own uploads, other guests' photos
- You can react, comment, tag people
- 6 months later, you open the app and it's all still there — along with every other event you've attended
- "On this day 1 year ago" memory notifications bring you back

**What the user sees:**

```

**The lock-in effect:** After 5–10 events, your history lives in this app. You can't get that anywhere else. It's not just photos — it's a timeline of every celebration in your life. Switching costs increase with every event you attend.

### Layer 2: Public Events & Venue Follows

Venues (pubs, clubs, bars, event spaces) and public events are followable. You follow a venue, and their public event photos appear in your feed.

**How it works:**
- A pub hosts a live music night and uses the product to collect photos
- The venue marks the event as "public"
- Public event photos appear in the feeds of anyone who follows that venue
- You discover new venues through friends' public check-ins
- You see what events are happening and what they look like — real photos, not stock images

**Why venues love this:**
- It's a free marketing channel. Every public event shows real, authentic photos to potential customers.
- Followers are a built-in audience for their next event.
- "Follow us on [Product] to see photos from our events" becomes the venue's version of "follow us on Instagram" — but more useful.
- It drives foot traffic: someone sees amazing photos from a pub's Friday night and thinks "I need to go there."

**Why users love this:**
- Discover what's actually happening at local venues — real photos, not promotional material.
- See friends who attended public events nearby.
- Follow venues you love and get a visual feed of their events.

---

## The "Easy Create" Conversion Funnel

This is the killer feature from a business perspective. Once someone has the app and has been a guest at 3–5 events, creating their own event is a single tap away.

**The funnel:**

```
Guest at someone else's event (free)
        ↓
Photos appear in their app (automatic)
        ↓
They attend 2-3 more events (familiarity builds)
        ↓
They're planning their own event (birthday, wedding, party)
        ↓
[ + Create Your Own Event ] is right there in the app
        ↓
They already know how the product works (they've been a guest)
        ↓
One tap → event creation flow → pay $2/guest → done
```

**Why this is so powerful:**
- **Zero education needed** — They've experienced the product as a guest. They know it works. They've seen the watermarks, the filters, the album. There's nothing to explain.
- **Zero trust gap** — They're not buying from a landing page. They're buying from inside a product they've used and enjoyed multiple times.
- **Frictionless** — The app is already on their phone. The payment is one screen. They're not "discovering a new product" — they're activating a feature of an app they already have.
- **Contextual** — The app can nudge at the right moment: "Planning a birthday? An anniversary? Create an event and collect photos from your guests, just like Sarah & James did at their wedding."

This is the guest email flywheel, but **10x more powerful** because the guest doesn't just have an email — they have the app, they have history, they have emotional investment.

---

## How Privacy Works

Privacy is core. The app doesn't expose anything by default.

| Event Type | Who sees it? | Who can find it? |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Private event** (wedding, birthday, party) | Only guests who scanned the QR and uploaded | Nobody — it doesn't appear in any public feed or search |
| **Private event — invited viewer** | Guests + anyone with the album share link (password-protected) | Nobody external — link-only access |
| **Public event** (venue night, brand activation) | Anyone who follows the venue + anyone who browses the venue page | Discoverable on the venue's public page and in "Discover" |
| **Your own uploads** | Only you (in your "Your Events" timeline) | Nobody else sees your personal timeline |

**Key principle:** Private events are invisible to the outside world. There's no "explore" feed showing strangers' weddings (unless the couple explicitly opts in to share). The app is a vault, not a broadcast channel.

---

## The Upload Evolution — QR Codes Become Optional

This is a fundamental shift in how the product works over time. The QR code is the entry point today, but the app eventually replaces it for most users.

### Three Upload Paths (Coexist)

| Path | Who Uses It | How It Works | When It Dominates |
|------|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **QR → Browser** | First-time guests, people without the app | Scan QR, browser opens, enter email, upload. Current flow, unchanged. | Now → always (it never goes away) |
| **QR → App** | Guests who have the app | Scan QR, app opens instead of browser, already logged in, upload instantly. No email entry, no friction. | Once app has traction (Phase 3+) |
| **App-only** | Guests who have the app and are already linked to the event | Open the app, see the event in "Your Events" (pushed via invite or auto-detected), tap, upload. No QR needed at all. | Mature phase — most uploads |

### How This Works in Practice

**Scenario 1: First-timer at a wedding (no app)**
Same as today. They scan the QR code on the table, browser opens, they enter their email, upload photos. After the event, they get an email: "See the full album — download the app to save your memories." If they install, the event appears in their app retroactively.

**Scenario 2: Returning guest with the app (scans QR)**
They scan the QR code, but instead of the browser opening, the app opens. They're already logged in. The app recognises the event and adds it to their timeline. They tap "Upload" — no email entry, no consent screen (already agreed on signup), no friction. Upload is 2 taps instead of 5 steps.

**Scenario 3: Guest with the app (no QR needed)**
The host added them to the guest list with their email. The app sends a push notification: "You're invited to Sarah & James's wedding — the event is live!" They open the app, the event is already there, they tap and upload. They never scanned a QR code at all. They could upload from the car on the way home, from the hotel room the next morning, or a week later when they find that perfect photo in their camera roll.

### Why This Matters

**For guests:**
- Path 1 (QR → browser) takes ~60 seconds and requires entering an email.
- Path 2 (QR → app) takes ~10 seconds. No typing.
- Path 3 (app-only) takes ~5 seconds. No scanning, no typing. Just open and upload.
- The easier it is to upload, the more photos you get. More photos = more value for the couple.

**For hosts/couples:**
- More upload paths = higher guest participation rates
- App users can upload after the event (they don't have to do it in the moment — they can go through their camera roll the next day)
- Late uploads catch the best content: the candid shots people find days later that they didn't think to upload at the time

**For the business:**
- The QR code was the product's defining feature. But it was always a solution to a problem: "How do we connect a guest to an event without making them download an app?" Once they have the app, that problem is solved. The QR code becomes a backup, not the main path.
- This is the ultimate lock-in. If most of your guests upload via the app, you don't even need QR codes at the event. The product works through the network, not through physical materials. That's a fundamentally stronger position.

### The Transition Over Time

```
Year 1:  95% QR → Browser  |  5% App
Year 2:  60% QR → Browser  |  25% QR → App  |  15% App-only
Year 3:  30% QR → Browser  |  30% QR → App  |  40% App-only
Year 4:  15% QR → Browser  |  25% QR → App  |  60% App-only
```

The QR code never disappears — there will always be first-timers, older guests, and people who don't want to install an app. But the balance shifts as the installed base grows. And every wedding where 50%+ of guests already have the app means:
- Higher upload rates (less friction)
- Faster uploads (no email entry)
- Post-event uploads (guests go through their camera roll the next day)
- The QR table cards become optional, not essential

### Host-Side: Inviting Through the App

Once the app exists, hosts can invite guests directly through it — not just by adding emails and generating QR codes:

**Current flow:**
```
Host adds guest emails → system generates QR codes → 
host prints QR cards → guest scans at event → uploads via browser
```

**App flow (additional option, not replacement):**
```
Host creates event in app → taps "Invite Guests" → 
selects from contacts OR enters emails → guests with the app get 
a push notification → event appears in their app → they upload 
whenever they want
```

Guests without the app still get an email with a QR code / upload link. Both paths coexist. But for the host, inviting through the app is faster than printing QR cards — especially for casual events (birthday parties, dinners) where printing feels overkill.

---

## Pre-Event Guest Notifications

This is a day-one feature, not an app-only feature. When the host adds guests with email addresses (or phone numbers), we reach out to them before the event to prime participation and drive app installs.

### The Pre-Event Message

Sent **1 day before** the event. Via email (and SMS/text if we have the number).

**Email version:**

```
Subject: You're invited to upload photos at Sarah & James's wedding!

Hey [Guest Name],

Sarah & James are using [Product] to collect photos from every 
guest at their wedding tomorrow. Here's how you can contribute:

📱 OPTION 1: Download the app (easiest)
   [Download for iOS]  [Download for Android]
   Your event code: SARAH-JAMES-2026

🔗 OPTION 2: Use this link (no app needed)
   [Upload photos here] — opens in your browser, no download required

📷 OPTION 3: Scan the QR code at the event
   Look for QR codes on the tables at the reception.

All photos will be watermarked with Sarah & James's names and 
added to their private wedding album.

See you at the celebration!
```

**SMS/Text version:**

```
Sarah & James invited you to share photos at their wedding 
tomorrow! 📸

Download the app: [short link]
Event code: SARAH-JAMES-2026

Or just use this link: [short link]
(No app needed — opens in your browser)
```

### Why This Matters

| Without pre-event notification | With pre-event notification |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Guest arrives at wedding, notices QR on table, maybe scans it | Guest already knows about the product before they arrive |
| Some guests ignore the QR — they're busy eating, dancing, drinking | Guest is primed to participate — they expected it |
| Upload rate: maybe 30–40% of guests | Upload rate: potentially 50–70% of guests |
| App installs: 0 (they don't know the app exists until after) | App installs: some guests download before the event |
| Guests only upload in-the-moment photos | Guests know they can upload up to 3 days after — they'll go through their camera roll later |

### The Three Options Are Strategic

Each option serves a different purpose:

**Option 1 — Download the app:** This is the ideal path. If they download before the event, they'll have the smoothest experience during and after. Plus they're now an app user — part of the long-term hub. The event code makes it dead simple to connect to the right event.

**Option 2 — Direct link:** For people who won't download an app for anything. Clicking the link takes them to the same browser upload page the QR code would. Zero friction. No app, no scan, just click and upload. They can even start uploading before the event (if they have photos from the rehearsal dinner, getting ready, etc.).

**Option 3 — QR at the event:** The fallback. Some people won't open the email, won't download the app, won't click the link. But they'll see the QR code on the table and scan it in the moment. This option is mentioned so they know to look for it.

### Event Codes

The event code (e.g., `SARAH-JAMES-2026`) is a new concept that matters for the app:

- **Short, memorable, human-readable** — not a UUID or random token
- **Entered in the app** to connect to an event (like joining a Zoom meeting with a code)
- **Shareable verbally** — the DJ can announce it: "Open [Product] and enter code SARAH-JAMES-2026 to upload your photos!"
- **Works without QR** — if someone doesn't have a QR code in front of them, they can still find the event
- **Unique per event** — auto-generated from couple's names + year, with collision handling

### Notification Timeline

| Timing | Channel | Message | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| **1 day before** | Email + SMS | "You're invited to upload photos at [Event]. Download the app / use this link / scan QR at the event." | Prime participation, drive app installs |
| **Event day (morning)** | Push notification (app users) | "[Event] is today! Open the app to start uploading photos." | Reminder for app users |
| **Event day (evening)** | Push notification (app users) | "The event is live — upload your photos!" | Trigger during the event |
| **Day after** | Email + push | "[Host] is building the album! You can still upload photos for the next 2 days." | Drive post-event uploads |
| **3 days after (window closing)** | Email + push | "Last chance to upload your photos from [Event]. The upload window closes tonight." | Urgency for final uploads |
| **Album shared** | Email + push | "The album from [Event] is ready! [X] guests contributed [Y] photos." | Deliver value, drive album engagement |

### Host Controls

The host should be able to:
- **Toggle pre-event notifications on/off** — Some hosts might want to keep the product a surprise (rare, but possible).
- **Customise the message** — Add a personal note: "Can't wait to see everyone tomorrow! Don't forget to upload your photos!"
- **Choose channels** — Email only, SMS only, or both. SMS costs money (we pay per text), so might be a premium feature or included above a certain guest count.
- **Set the upload window** — Default 3 days, but the host can extend (up to 7 days) or shorten (close immediately after event).

### SMS Considerations

- **Cost:** SMS costs ~$0.01–$0.03 per message. For a 150-guest wedding, that's $1.50–$4.50. Trivial per event, but at scale (200 weddings/month × 150 guests) = $30k–$90k/year in SMS costs.
- **Options:**
  - Include SMS in the $2/guest price (absorb the cost — it drives participation which drives value)
  - Make SMS a premium feature (+$0.10/guest or flat $10 add-on)
  - Email only by default, SMS opt-in
- **Recommendation:** Include email notifications in the base price. SMS as an optional add-on for $10/event. It's a no-brainer upsell at checkout: "Add text reminders for $10 — increase guest participation by up to 30%."

### What This Means for Venue Events

For venues, the app evolution is even more powerful:

**Today:** Venue prints QR codes on tables. Every guest at every event scans with their phone camera, opens browser, enters email.

**With the app:** Regulars already have the app and follow the venue. When the venue creates a new event, followers get a push notification. They walk into the pub on Friday night, the event is already in their app, they just upload. No scanning, no table cards, no friction.

The venue's QR codes on tables are just for first-timers. Regulars — the people who come every week — skip the QR entirely. They're already connected.

```
First visit:    Scan QR → browser → email → upload → "Get the app"
Second visit:   Scan QR → app opens → upload (faster)
Third visit:    Open app → event is there → upload (no scan needed)
Every visit after: Just open the app and go
```

---

## What This Does to the Business

### Lock-In Through History

This is the most important strategic effect. Every other photo collection tool is transactional — use it once, forget it. The app turns the product into an accumulating asset:

| Events Attended | Lock-In Level | Switching Cost |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| 1 | None — you could delete the app tomorrow | Zero — it's just one album |
| 3 | Low — you've got a few nice memories in there | Mild inconvenience |
| 5–10 | Medium — this is becoming your event photo archive | You'd lose years of memories |
| 10+ | High — your entire social/celebration history lives here | Unthinkable — like leaving Instagram after 5 years |

No competitor can replicate your personal history. They can copy features, match pricing, clone the watermark. They can't give you back 3 years of wedding and party memories.

### The Venue Flywheel

Venue accounts become dramatically more valuable with the app:

```
Venue hosts events → guests get the app → guests follow the venue →
venue's public photos reach followers → followers visit the venue →
more events → more guests → more followers → bigger audience
```

The venue's follower count becomes a genuine marketing asset. "Follow us on [Product] — 2,400 followers" is a real CTA that drives foot traffic. This makes venue accounts stickier and justifies the subscription pricing.

### Guest-to-Creator Conversion Rate Explodes

Without the app, converting a guest to a paying customer requires: email → click → visit website → understand product → sign up → create event → pay. That's 6 steps with drop-off at each one.

With the app: they're already in the product. They already understand it. They tap "Create Event." That's 1 step.

**Expected conversion lift:** 3–5x higher guest-to-creator conversion with the app vs. email-only.

---

## Social Features Within Events

Each event in the app is a private, interactive space — not a static album.

### What Guests Can Do Inside an Event

- **React to photos** — Heart, laugh, cry (event-appropriate reactions, not a generic "like")
- **Comment** — "Oh my god this is the best photo of grandma"
- **Tag people** — "That's @Sarah behind the DJ booth"
- **Highlight favourites** — "This was my favourite moment" — guests vote on the best shots
- **See a live feed during the event** — Photos appear in real-time as guests upload. Creates a live, collective experience during the event itself.

### What the Host Can Do

- **Pin favourites** to the top of the album
- **Feature a "Best Of"** selection on the event page
- **Send a notification** to all guests: "The album is ready! Come see it."
- **Share externally** — Password-protected link still works for people not on the app

### Notifications That Bring People Back

| Trigger | Notification | Timing |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| New album shared | "Sarah & James shared their wedding album — you contributed 14 photos!" | Post-event |
| Someone reacted to your photo | "Emma loved your photo from the wedding" | Real-time |
| Someone commented | "Tom commented on your photo: 'Legendary dance move'" | Real-time |
| Your photo was pinned | "The couple pinned your photo as a favourite!" | When it happens |
| Memory anniversary | "1 year ago today, you were at Priya & Raj's wedding" | Annual |
| Year in review | "You attended 7 events in 2026. See your highlights." | End of year |
| Venue you follow has new event | "The Crown & Anchor posted photos from Friday Night Jazz" | Post-event |

---

## App Screens Overview

### Tab 1: Your Events (Home)

Your personal timeline of every event you've attended, most recent first. Grouped by year. Each card shows the event name, date, photo count, and how many you contributed. Tap to open.

### Tab 2: Following (Venues & Public)

A feed of public event photos from venues you follow. Discover new venues nearby. See what's happening in your city. Each venue card shows their latest event and follower count.

### Tab 3: Create

One-tap event creation. Pre-filled with smart defaults based on event type (wedding, birthday, party, corporate). For returning users, it remembers their preferences (watermark style, filter choice).

The create flow for someone who's already been a guest is nearly instant — they know the product, they trust it, they just need to fill in the details and pay.

### Tab 4: Profile

Your name, photo, events attended, total photos contributed. Settings, account management, notification preferences.

"Your year in review" lives here. Shareable — "I attended 7 events in 2026 and contributed 89 photos" → share to Instagram Stories (with branding — free marketing).

## Why This Works — Strategic Advantages

### The Guest Email List Is an App Install Base Waiting to Happen

By Phase 2, the product captures ~20,000 guest emails per month. By Phase 3, ~56,000/month. Within 12 months, you could have 250,000–500,000 email addresses of people who have already used the product.

Right now, those emails sit in a nurture sequence. But with the app, those emails become **app installs at zero cost**:

> "Your photos from Sarah & James's wedding are now in the app. Download to see your memories, react to photos, and save your favourites."

This is a fundamentally different push than "download our app to upload photos." The guest already has content waiting for them. The app isn't an ask — it's a delivery mechanism for something they already want.

### Every Event Seeds Users in Clusters

Instagram grew user by user. A single wedding seeds 150 users in one night. Ten weddings in a weekend = 1,500 users. If even 20% download the app, that's 300 new app users per weekend from organic product usage alone.

And unlike Instagram, these users arrive in **clusters** — they already know each other. Social features (comments, tags, reactions) have built-in engagement from day one because the people in the photos are your actual friends and family.

### The Content Is Inherently Premium

Wedding photos are emotional, beautiful, and high-stakes. People care deeply about them. This isn't food photos or gym selfies — it's once-in-a-lifetime moments. That emotional intensity drives:
- Higher engagement (people revisit wedding photos for years)
- Higher willingness to pay (for prints, books, slideshows, extended hosting)
- Higher share rates (people share wedding photos with pride)
- Higher quality content (even phone photos at weddings look good — the subjects are dressed up, the venues are decorated, the lighting is intentional)

### It Changes the Competitive Conversation

Right now, the product competes with The Guest app, disposable cameras, and Google Photos. As a social platform, it competes with... nobody. There's no "Instagram for weddings" or "social network for celebrations." You'd be creating a category, not competing in one.

## Risks & Honest Concerns

### "No App Required" Is the Core Differentiator

The entire marketing plan is built on "guests don't need to download anything." An app seems to undermine that message.

**Why it doesn't:** The app is for after the event, not during. The QR → browser upload flow is untouched. Guests at a wedding never need to download anything. The app is the post-event experience: "Want to save your memories and see the final album? Download the app." The zero-friction upload principle is preserved for the critical moment. The app is optional but valuable.

### Building an App Is a Major Investment

Native iOS + Android development, push notifications, accounts/auth, real-time features, app store approvals and reviews. This is a different beast from a Next.js web app.

**Mitigation:** Start with a PWA (Progressive Web App). It works on both platforms, supports push notifications, can be "installed" to the home screen, and uses the existing web codebase. Test whether the hub concept works before committing to native. If engagement proves out, go native.

### Risk of Overcomplicating a Simple Product

The current product is beautiful because it's simple. Adding social features and an app could bloat it into something confusing.

**Mitigation:** The app's primary screen is just a list of events you attended. Tap one → see photos. That's it. Social features (reactions, comments) are secondary. The core experience stays dead simple. Never add features that require explanation.

### Focus Risk — Core Product Isn't Proven Yet

Product-market fit for the event collection tool needs to come first. Building an app before the core works is premature.

**Agreement:** This is absolutely right. The app is a Phase 3+ play (month 12+). But the vision should inform decisions made today — especially around guest accounts, data architecture, and the email capture flow. Build the foundations now even if the app comes later.

---

## Phased Build Plan

Each phase validates the next. Don't build Phase 3 until Phase 2 proves people come back.

### Phase 1: Interactive Albums (Month 6–9)

**Add to the existing browser-based album page:**
- Reactions on photos (heart, laugh, cry)
- Comments
- "This was my favourite" guest highlights
- Host pins favourites to the top
- Notifications via email: "3 guests reacted to your photos"

**What you learn:** Do guests actually come back to the album? Do reactions/comments drive re-engagement? How many times does a guest revisit?

**Build cost:** Low. Feature additions to the existing album page. No app required.

**Success metric:** 30%+ of guests revisit the album at least once after initial viewing.

---

### Phase 2: Guest Accounts & Event History (Month 9–14)

**Add optional guest accounts:**
- "Save your memories" prompt after upload → create a lightweight account (email + password, or social login)
- "Your Events" page: every event you've contributed to, with your photos
- Memory notification emails: "1 year ago today, you were at Sarah & James's wedding"
- Cross-event connections: "You and Sarah were both at 3 events together"
- "Create Your Own Event" CTA prominent on the Your Events page

**What you learn:** What % of guests create accounts? Do memory notifications drive re-engagement? Does having an account increase guest-to-creator conversion?

**Build cost:** Medium. Requires auth for guests, profile pages, event history logic.

**Success metric:** 20%+ of uploading guests create an account. Account holders convert to event creators at 2x the rate of email-only guests.

---

### Phase 3: The App — PWA First (Month 12–18)

**Launch a Progressive Web App (PWA) with:**
- "Your Events" timeline (the core hub)
- "Following" tab for venues
- Push notifications for album activity and memory anniversaries
- One-tap event creation
- One-tap reshare to Instagram/TikTok (with watermark — free marketing)
- "Discover Venues Near You" basic location-based browsing

**Why PWA first:** Works on iOS and Android. No App Store approval needed. Uses the existing web codebase. Supports push notifications. Can be "installed" to the home screen. Tests the hub concept without the massive investment of native development.

**What you learn:** Do people actually install it? What's the weekly active rate? Does the app drive more event creation? Does the venue follow feature get traction?

**Build cost:** Medium. PWA is significantly cheaper than native. Most of the logic already exists in the web app.

**Success metric:** 15%+ of account holders install the PWA. App users create events at 3x the rate of non-app users.

---

### Phase 4: Native App + Public Layer (Month 18–24)

**Go native (iOS + Android) if PWA metrics justify it:**
- Full native experience (smoother, faster, better push notifications)
- Venue public pages with photo galleries and follower counts
- "Discover" tab: browse venues, see public events nearby
- Year-in-review shareable cards
- Photographer portfolios (for Pro accounts)
- In-app photobook ordering

**Build cost:** High. Native development is a major investment. Only justified if PWA engagement proves the concept.

**Success metric:** 100k+ app installs within 6 months of launch. 40%+ monthly retention.

## How This Affects the Business Model

| Feature | Monetisation |
|---------|-------------|
| Reactions & comments (Layer 1) | Free — drives engagement and retention |
| Guest accounts (Layer 2) | Free — grows the user base for future monetisation |
| Memory notifications (Layer 2) | Free, but include "Create your own event" CTA — conversion channel |
| Native app (Layer 3) | Free to download — monetisation stays on event creation |
| One-tap reshare (Layer 3) | Free — organic marketing (watermark visible in reshare) |
| Public feed (Layer 4) | Free to browse — drives top-of-funnel. Potential for promoted listings (venues, photographers pay to be featured) |
| Photographer portfolio (Layer 4) | Freemium — basic listing free, premium features (analytics, lead gen, featured placement) for a monthly fee |
| In-app prints/photobooks | Revenue from print-on-demand partnerships |
| Premium memories (Layer 2+) | Potential subscription: "Keep all your memories forever" for $2.99/month (vs. 12-month free hosting) |

The social layer doesn't need to be directly monetised. It's a **retention and acquisition engine** that makes the core product (event creation at $2/guest) more valuable and more discoverable.

## The Reshare Angle — Watermarks as Viral Branding

This deserves special attention. If guests can one-tap reshare a watermarked photo to Instagram or TikTok, the AI watermark becomes a viral branding mechanism:

- Guest posts a beautiful wedding photo to their Instagram Story
- The watermark says "Emma & Liam — June 14, 2026"
- Small "Collected with [Product]" text in the corner
- Their 500 followers see it. Some are engaged couples planning their own wedding.
- "What's [Product]?" → Google → signup

**Every reshare is a free ad.** And unlike paid ads, it comes from a real person sharing a real photo from a real wedding. It's the most authentic, trustworthy form of advertising possible.

If 10% of guests reshare one photo, and average guest has 400 followers:
- 150 guests × 10% × 400 followers = **6,000 impressions per wedding**
- 200 weddings/month × 6,000 = **1.2 million impressions/month**
- All free. All authentic. All with a branded watermark.

This alone might justify building the app.

## Naming Implications

If the product evolves from a tool to a social platform, the name matters even more:

| Name | Works as Tool? | Works as Social App? | Notes |
|------|---------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Afterglow** | Yes | Yes — "Open Afterglow to relive the night" | Strong for both. The afterglow is the social moment — revisiting, reacting, remembering. |
| **Confetti** | Yes | Yes — "Your Confetti feed" / "Confetti memories" | Playful, social-friendly. |
| **Toast** | Yes | Moderate — "Toast" as an app name might confuse with Toast POS | The verb works socially ("Toast this moment") but the naming conflict gets worse at app scale. |
| **Heirloom** | Yes | Less natural — "Your Heirloom feed" feels heavy | Better as a tool than a social platform. Too premium/quiet for social energy. |
| **Mosaic** | Yes | Yes — "Your Mosaic" / "See the full Mosaic" | Works metaphorically for a social feed (many pieces, one picture). |

**Afterglow** and **Confetti** both work well for a social evolution. Heirloom feels less natural in a social context.

## Open Questions

- [ ] Does the market want this? Need to talk to 20+ guests post-wedding. Do they revisit the album? Do they wish they could comment/react? Would they install an app to see their event history?
- [ ] PWA vs native — is PWA good enough for the core hub experience, or do the push notification and performance limitations matter too much?
- [ ] What's the realistic install rate? If 20% of guests install, that's 30 installs per wedding. If 5%, that's only 7–8. Need to test the prompt and value proposition.
- [ ] How do venue follows work with privacy? If you follow a pub and they post public event photos, can other followers see that you were at the same event? (Probably not — keep attendance private, just show the venue's curated public photos.)
- [ ] Does this change the fundraising story? A personal event hub with network effects and lock-in is a much bigger TAM than a wedding photo tool — but it's also a bigger bet.
- [ ] How do Pro accounts fit? Does a photographer get a public profile in the app? Can couples find Pros through the app? (This connects to the Pro Directory concept.)
- [ ] Moderation for public venue content — user reports, community guidelines, AI content filtering. Needed before venue follows launch.
- [ ] Data architecture decisions needed NOW (even before app): Should guests be creating accounts today? Should we start tracking which events a guest has attended across multiple email-based uploads? Building this data layer early makes the app launch much easier later.

## Decisions — Build Now

These affect the current web product and should be implemented from day one, regardless of when the app ships.

### Confirmed (Building These)

1. **Deep link-ready QR URLs:** All QR code URLs must support deep linking from day one (Universal Links on iOS, App Links on Android). If the guest has the app, QR opens the app. If not, falls through to browser. The URL structure needs to be right now — retrofitting later is painful. This is invisible to the user.

2. **3-day post-event upload window:** Uploads stay open for 72 hours after the event ends. Guests can go through their camera roll the next morning and upload the photos they forgot about. Host can adjust (extend to 7 days, or close immediately). The app makes this natural, but the behaviour starts now.

3. **Pre-event guest notifications:** When the host adds guest emails (and optionally phone numbers), send a notification 1 day before the event. Three options: download the app + event code, direct upload link, or scan QR at the event. Drives participation and app installs before the event even starts.

4. **Event codes:** Human-readable, memorable codes (e.g., `SARAH-JAMES-2026`) that guests can enter in the app or type into a URL. Works without a QR code. DJ can announce it. Guests can share it verbally. Auto-generated from event details with collision handling.

### Should Build Soon

5. **Guest accounts (optional):** After upload, prompt "Create an account to save your memories." Even if the app is a year away, start building the account base and event history data now.

6. **Event history tracking:** When a guest uploads to multiple events using the same email, link them. This data is the foundation of "Your Events" even if it's only visible later.

7. **Reactions on albums:** Add heart/laugh/cry reactions to the existing album page. Low-cost, validates engagement, and works without an app.

8. **Reshare formatting:** When guests share a photo externally, make sure the watermark looks great on Instagram Stories (9:16 ratio, clean placement). Free marketing whether or not an app exists.

### Build When Venue Accounts Ship

9. **Venue public/private flag:** Include a "public" toggle for events. Public events appear on the venue's web profile page and later in the app's "Following" feed.

10. **Event-based push notifications for venue followers:** When a venue creates a new event, push a notification to followers. "The Crown & Anchor just posted photos from Friday Night Jazz."
