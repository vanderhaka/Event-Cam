# Alignment — Start Here

If you want one aligned path quickly, use the documents in this order:

1. **Read strategic critique first**  
   `MARKETING-DOCS-REVIEW.md`  
   - Understand core risks, contradictions, and prioritized fixes.

2. **Answer path-defining questions second**  
   `QUESTIONS-THAT-NEED-ANSWERS.md`  
   - Resolve Priority 0 decisions before expansion work.

3. **Convert answers into one executable path third**  
   `PATH-ALIGNMENT-WORKSHEET.md`  
   - Select one path, set KPI contract, lock boundaries, assign owners.

4. **Run operating cadence and tracking artifacts**
   - `ALIGNMENT-MEETING-CADENCE.md`
   - `ALIGNMENT-SCORECARD.md`
   - `ALIGNMENT-DECISIONS-LOG.md`
   - `ALIGNMENT-DECISION-INTAKE-QUEUE.md`
   - `ALIGNMENT-WEEKLY-EXECUTIVE-PACKET.md`
   - `ALIGNMENT-ACTIVE-ARTIFACT-SET.md`
   - `ALIGNMENT-COMMAND-CENTER.md`

5. **Use full artifact map if unsure where to go next**
   `ALIGNMENT-ARTIFACTS-INDEX.md`

6. **If canonical-source conflicts appear, use:**
   `ALIGNMENT-CANONICAL-SOURCE-MAP.md`

7. **If process load feels too high or too low, tune mode first**
   `ALIGNMENT-OPERATING-MODES.md`

8. **If you need urgency: run the fast-start sequence**
   `ALIGNMENT-QUICKSTART-48H.md`

9. **If your team needs staged rollout instead of full activation**
   `ALIGNMENT-ADOPTION-ROADMAP.md`

## 7-Step Alignment Flow

1. Confirm decision authority (who signs off pricing, narrative, and channel spend).
2. Close all Priority 0 questions.
3. Reconcile pricing/economics contradictions across strategy docs.
4. Pick one primary path for the next 90 days.
5. Define what is out-of-scope this quarter.
6. Set weekly KPI cadence and experiment pass/kill thresholds.
7. Run 30/60/90 checkpoints and adjust only with documented decision logs.

---

## Minimum Exit Criteria (You Are “Aligned” When…)

- Priority 0 questions are closed with owner/date.
- One canonical pricing model is published and consistent across docs.
- One quarterly narrative is approved and documented.
- One primary growth loop is chosen.
- KPI owners and review cadence are active.
- Boundaries (“not doing now”) are explicit.

If any of the above is missing, alignment is incomplete.

## Week-1 Kickoff Pack (Practical)

If you need to start this week, run this exact pack:

1. `QUESTIONS-THAT-NEED-ANSWERS.md` (close Priority 0 items)
2. `ALIGNMENT-DECISION-CALENDAR.md` (assign dates/owners)
3. `ALIGNMENT-DECISIONS-LOG.md` (record finalized decisions)
4. `PATH-ALIGNMENT-WORKSHEET.md` (lock one 90-day path)
5. `ALIGNMENT-CHECKLIST.md` (verify readiness)

This pack is enough to move from strategy debate to aligned execution.

## Ongoing Weekly Control (After Kickoff)

Once week-1 setup is done, run this minimum weekly loop:

1. `ALIGNMENT-COMMAND-CENTER.md` (weekly scan and commitments)
2. `ALIGNMENT-WEEKLY-EXECUTIVE-PACKET.md` (leadership-ready output)
3. `ALIGNMENT-SYSTEM-HEALTH-METRICS.md` (meta-discipline health)
4. `ALIGNMENT-ACTIVE-ARTIFACT-SET.md` (active/frozen set integrity)
5. `ALIGNMENT-DECISION-INTAKE-QUEUE.md` (new request triage discipline)
6. `ALIGNMENT-DECISION-OUTCOME-REVIEWS.md` (impact verification on closed decisions)
7. `ALIGNMENT-MEETING-EFFECTIVENESS-REVIEW.md` (meeting-yield and governance-efficiency check)
8. `ALIGNMENT-ARTIFACT-USAGE-TELEMETRY.md` (active-control utilization and sprawl check)
9. `ALIGNMENT-CONTROL-SUNSET-CRITERIA.md` (safe control-retirement gate)
10. `ALIGNMENT-DECISION-CONFIDENCE-INDEX.md` (pre-approval conviction and uncertainty visibility)
11. `ALIGNMENT-DECISION-CALIBRATION-REPORT.md` (monthly confidence-vs-outcome accuracy check)
12. `ALIGNMENT-EVIDENCE-REFRESH-SCHEDULE.md` (evidence freshness and expiry gate)
13. `ALIGNMENT-OVERRIDE-REGISTER.md` (exception tracking and expiry discipline)
14. `ALIGNMENT-GOVERNANCE-COST-BUDGET.md` (cost-to-value guardrail for process load)
15. `ALIGNMENT-CONTROL-PORTFOLIO-REVIEW.md` (quarterly keep/merge/retire decisions)
16. `ALIGNMENT-GOVERNANCE-ROI-REPORT.md` (monthly proof that governance value exceeds governance cost)
17. `ALIGNMENT-CONTROL-PRECEDENCE-RULES.md` (tie-break system for conflicting controls)
18. `ALIGNMENT-CONTROL-CHANGE-PROTOCOL.md` (safe rollout/rollback for control updates)
19. `ALIGNMENT-AUTOMATION-PRIORITIZATION-SCORECARD.md` (highest-impact automation sequencing)
20. `ALIGNMENT-SIGNAL-LAG-ANALYSIS.md` (detection-to-action response speed control)
21. `ALIGNMENT-CONTROL-FAILURE-MODES.md` (recurring control-breakdown containment and redesign)
22. `ALIGNMENT-ESCALATION-EFFECTIVENESS-REVIEW.md` (root-cause closure quality and escalation recurrence control)
23. `ALIGNMENT-CORRECTIVE-ACTION-TRACKER.md` (single queue for verified closure of corrective work)
24. `ALIGNMENT-CLOSURE-INTEGRITY-AUDIT.md` (audit check that closed statuses are evidence-valid)
25. `ALIGNMENT-LEADING-INDICATOR-WATCHLIST.md` (early-warning scan before lagging KPIs break)
26. `ALIGNMENT-PREVENTIVE-ACTION-REVIEW.md` (proves whether preventive actions reduced downstream failure)
27. `ALIGNMENT-THRESHOLD-CALIBRATION-REVIEW.md` (keeps warning thresholds predictive and actionable)

If this loop stops, alignment drift usually follows within 2–4 weeks.

## Quarter Transition Rule

At quarter-end, run:

`ALIGNMENT-QUARTER-RESET-PROTOCOL.md`

Do not start the next quarter without:
- refreshed path worksheet,
- updated active artifact set,
- updated week-1 commitments.

## If You’re Starting From Chaos

Use this order:

1. `ALIGNMENT-QUICKSTART-48H.md` (stabilize fast)
2. `ALIGNMENT-SYSTEM-OVERVIEW.md` (understand the full model)
3. `ALIGNMENT-ARTIFACTS-INDEX.md` (route to exact artifact needed)

This minimizes analysis paralysis and gets you into execution quickly.
