# Alignment — Start Here

If you want one aligned path quickly, use the documents in this order:

1. **Read strategic critique first**  
   `MARKETING-DOCS-REVIEW.md`  
   - Understand core risks, contradictions, and prioritized fixes.

2. **Answer path-defining questions second**  
   `QUESTIONS-THAT-NEED-ANSWERS.md`  
   - Resolve Priority 0 decisions before expansion work.

3. **Convert answers into one executable path third**  
   `PATH-ALIGNMENT-WORKSHEET.md`  
   - Select one path, set KPI contract, lock boundaries, assign owners.

4. **Run operating cadence and tracking artifacts**
   - `ALIGNMENT-MEETING-CADENCE.md`
   - `ALIGNMENT-SCORECARD.md`
   - `ALIGNMENT-DECISIONS-LOG.md`
   - `ALIGNMENT-DECISION-INTAKE-QUEUE.md`
   - `ALIGNMENT-WEEKLY-EXECUTIVE-PACKET.md`
   - `ALIGNMENT-ACTIVE-ARTIFACT-SET.md`
   - `ALIGNMENT-COMMAND-CENTER.md`

5. **Use full artifact map if unsure where to go next**
   `ALIGNMENT-ARTIFACTS-INDEX.md`

6. **If canonical-source conflicts appear, use:**
   `ALIGNMENT-CANONICAL-SOURCE-MAP.md`

7. **If process load feels too high or too low, tune mode first**
   `ALIGNMENT-OPERATING-MODES.md`

8. **If you need urgency: run the fast-start sequence**
   `ALIGNMENT-QUICKSTART-48H.md`

9. **If your team needs staged rollout instead of full activation**
   `ALIGNMENT-ADOPTION-ROADMAP.md`

## 7-Step Alignment Flow

1. Confirm decision authority (who signs off pricing, narrative, and channel spend).
2. Close all Priority 0 questions.
3. Reconcile pricing/economics contradictions across strategy docs.
4. Pick one primary path for the next 90 days.
5. Define what is out-of-scope this quarter.
6. Set weekly KPI cadence and experiment pass/kill thresholds.
7. Run 30/60/90 checkpoints and adjust only with documented decision logs.

---

## Minimum Exit Criteria (You Are “Aligned” When…)

- Priority 0 questions are closed with owner/date.
- One canonical pricing model is published and consistent across docs.
- One quarterly narrative is approved and documented.
- One primary growth loop is chosen.
- KPI owners and review cadence are active.
- Boundaries (“not doing now”) are explicit.

If any of the above is missing, alignment is incomplete.

## Week-1 Kickoff Pack (Practical)

If you need to start this week, run this exact pack:

1. `QUESTIONS-THAT-NEED-ANSWERS.md` (close Priority 0 items)
2. `ALIGNMENT-DECISION-CALENDAR.md` (assign dates/owners)
3. `ALIGNMENT-DECISIONS-LOG.md` (record finalized decisions)
4. `PATH-ALIGNMENT-WORKSHEET.md` (lock one 90-day path)
5. `ALIGNMENT-CHECKLIST.md` (verify readiness)

This pack is enough to move from strategy debate to aligned execution.

## Quarter Transition Rule

At quarter-end, run:

`ALIGNMENT-QUARTER-RESET-PROTOCOL.md`

Do not start the next quarter without:
- refreshed path worksheet,
- updated active artifact set,
- updated week-1 commitments.

---

## If You’re Starting From Chaos

Use this order:

1. `ALIGNMENT-QUICKSTART-48H.md` (stabilize fast)
2. `ALIGNMENT-SYSTEM-OVERVIEW.md` (understand the full model)
3. `ALIGNMENT-ARTIFACTS-INDEX.md` (route to exact artifact needed)

This minimizes analysis paralysis and gets you into execution quickly.
