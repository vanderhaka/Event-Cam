# Alignment — Start Here

If you want one aligned path quickly, use the documents in this order:

1. **Read strategic critique first**  
   `MARKETING-DOCS-REVIEW.md`  
   - Understand core risks, contradictions, and prioritized fixes.

2. **Answer path-defining questions second**  
   `QUESTIONS-THAT-NEED-ANSWERS.md`  
   - Resolve Priority 0 decisions before expansion work.

3. **Convert answers into one executable path third**  
   `PATH-ALIGNMENT-WORKSHEET.md`  
   - Select one path, set KPI contract, lock boundaries, assign owners.

## 7-Step Alignment Flow

1. Confirm decision authority (who signs off pricing, narrative, and channel spend).
2. Close all Priority 0 questions.
3. Reconcile pricing/economics contradictions across strategy docs.
4. Pick one primary path for the next 90 days.
5. Define what is out-of-scope this quarter.
6. Set weekly KPI cadence and experiment pass/kill thresholds.
7. Run 30/60/90 checkpoints and adjust only with documented decision logs.

---

## Minimum Exit Criteria (You Are “Aligned” When…)

- Priority 0 questions are closed with owner/date.
- One canonical pricing model is published and consistent across docs.
- One quarterly narrative is approved and documented.
- One primary growth loop is chosen.
- KPI owners and review cadence are active.
- Boundaries (“not doing now”) are explicit.

If any of the above is missing, alignment is incomplete.
