# Alignment FAQ

> Quick answers to common execution questions while running the alignment system.

---

## 1) What does “aligned” actually mean?

You are aligned when:
- Priority 0 decisions are closed,
- one 90-day path is selected and signed,
- pricing/economics contradictions are resolved across docs,
- weekly KPI + decision cadence is operating.

---

## 2) Can we run multiple paths in parallel?

No.  
You can have:
- one **primary** path,
- one **support** loop.

Running multiple primary paths destroys learning speed and owner clarity.

---

## 3) What if leadership disagrees on a Priority 0 decision?

Use:
1. `ALIGNMENT-PRIORITY0-DECISION-BRIEF.md` to structure the decision.
2. Decision authority defined in `ALIGNMENT-RACI.md`.
3. Escalation rule in `QUESTIONS-THAT-NEED-ANSWERS.md` if blocked beyond due window.

---

## 4) How quickly should docs be updated after a decision?

Within 48 hours.  
Track this with the documentation sync SLA in `ALIGNMENT-METRIC-DEFINITIONS.md`.

---

## 5) What if a “closed” decision needs to change?

Do not overwrite silently.
- Add a superseded entry in `ALIGNMENT-DECISIONS-LOG.md`.
- Record why it changed and what evidence triggered the change.
- Re-sync affected docs.

---

## 6) How many experiments should run at once?

Maximum 5 concurrent experiments.  
If new ideas arrive, kill/graduate existing experiments first.

---

## 7) What should we do if alignment score drops below 13?

Follow mandatory actions from `ALIGNMENT-SCORECARD.md`:
- 13–16: fix top 2 gaps in 7 days.
- 9–12: leadership checkpoint in 72 hours + freeze new initiatives.
- 0–8: immediate reset and close Priority 0 decisions first.

---

## 8) Which artifact should the team open first each week?

1. `ALIGNMENT-DASHBOARD-TEMPLATE.md` (weekly snapshot)
2. `ALIGNMENT-SCORECARD.md` (health score)
3. `ALIGNMENT-DECISIONS-LOG.md` (decision deltas)

---

## 9) What blocks channel scaling?

Do not scale channels if any of these are missing:
- agreed KPI definitions,
- reliable CAC/payback view,
- pass/kill thresholds on active experiments,
- unresolved Priority 0 decisions.

---

## 10) What blocks expansion beyond core market?

Expansion is blocked until:
- one core path produces measurable progress,
- contradiction backlog is closed,
- retention and economics are stable enough to absorb additional complexity.
