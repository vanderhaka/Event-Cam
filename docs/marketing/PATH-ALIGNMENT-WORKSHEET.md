## 1) Decision Inputs (Pull From Question Log)

| Input | Final Decision | Confidence (H/M/L) | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primary market (P0-1) |  |  |  |
| Canonical pricing (P0-2) |  |  |  |
| Pro economics (P0-3) |  |  |  |
| Dominant growth loop (P0-4) |  |  |  |
| Message architecture (P0-5) |  |  |  |
| Compliance baseline (P0-6) |  |  |  |

If any row above is blank, stop and close those decisions first.

## 2) Choose One Path (Only One)

Select one route for the quarter:

- [ ] **Path A — Wedding Core + Pro Loop**
  - Primary objective: maximize paid wedding events via partner-led distribution.
  - Secondary objective: stabilize referral economics and partner activation.

- [ ] **Path B — Wedding Core + Guest Flywheel**
  - Primary objective: maximize guest capture quality and guest-to-creator conversion.
  - Secondary objective: improve lifecycle conversion economics.

- [ ] **Path C — Wedding Core + Content Engine**
  - Primary objective: improve top-of-funnel volume and conversion quality through organic/earned channels.
  - Secondary objective: build repeatable channel playbooks.

Rule: do not run two primary paths in parallel.

## 3) 90-Day Strategic Commitments

### What we WILL do (max 5 commitments)
1.  
2.  
3.  
4.  
5.  

### What we will NOT do this quarter (max 5 boundaries)
1.  
2.  
3.  
4.  
5.  

These boundaries are as important as the commitments.

## 4) KPI Contract for the Chosen Path

| KPI | Baseline | 90-Day Target | Owner | Weekly Review? |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Visitor → Signup conversion |  |  |  |  |
| Signup → Event creation conversion |  |  |  |  |
| Event creation → Paid conversion |  |  |  |  |
| Upload participation rate |  |  |  |  |
| Chosen loop KPI (primary) |  |  |  |  |
| CAC / Payback (if paid channels active) |  |  |  |  |

If targets are undefined, path is not aligned yet.

## 5) Risk Register (Top 5)

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |

## 6) 30/60/90 Checkpoints

### Day 30 checkpoint
- Are we on one path, or drifting across multiple?
- Are Priority 0 decisions still stable?
- Are any commitments blocked?

### Day 60 checkpoint
- Which experiments are scaled / held / killed?
- Are KPI trends supporting the chosen path?
- Do any assumptions need reclassification?

### Day 90 checkpoint
- Did this path produce measurable progress?
- Should the same path continue for another quarter?
- What single expansion decision (if any) is now justified?
