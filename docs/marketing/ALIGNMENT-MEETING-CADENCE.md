# Alignment Meeting Cadence

> Purpose: define the recurring meeting system that keeps strategic alignment active (not one-and-done).

---

## Meeting Stack (Weekly + Monthly)

| Meeting | Cadence | Duration | Owner | Core Output |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| KPI Standup | Weekly | 30 min | Growth Lead | Scale / hold / kill decisions on active work |
| Decision Review | Weekly | 45 min | Founder / Strategy Owner | Close open decisions and unblock blockers |
| Experiment Review | Weekly | 45 min | Growth Lead | Promote experiments to scale or terminate |
| Risk Review | Biweekly | 30 min | Ops / PMO | Updated top-5 risk register with owners |
| Strategy Sync | Monthly | 60 min | Leadership | Reconfirm one-path focus and quarter boundaries |

---

## Weekly KPI Standup Agenda (30 min)

1. Funnel movement vs target (10 min)
2. Channel efficiency update (10 min)
3. Blockers/escalations (5 min)
4. Decisions and owners for next 7 days (5 min)

### Required artifacts
- KPI dashboard
- Active experiment register
- Decision log (latest entries)

---

## Weekly Decision Review Agenda (45 min)

1. Open Priority 0/1 questions status
2. Blocked decisions and unblock owners
3. New decisions needed this week
4. Doc sync assignments after decisions

### Decision hygiene rules
- No decision closes without owner/date/docs-to-update.
- No “tentative” labels for Priority 0 after decision date.
- Any reversals require a superseded decision entry.

---

## Weekly Experiment Review Agenda (45 min)

1. Review each active experiment vs pass/kill threshold
2. Mark status: Scale / Iterate / Kill
3. Confirm no more than 5 concurrent experiments
4. Assign next-step owners and due dates

---

## Monthly Strategy Sync Agenda (60 min)

1. Reconfirm primary market and dominant growth loop
2. Review assumption confidence changes
3. Validate boundaries (“what we are not doing”)
4. Approve any path changes (only with evidence)

### Monthly output pack
- Board reporting format (from review doc)
- Updated path worksheet
- Updated decision calendar status

## Attendance Matrix

| Role | KPI Standup | Decision Review | Experiment Review | Monthly Strategy Sync |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Founder / CEO | Optional | Required | Optional | Required |
| Marketing Lead | Required | Required | Optional | Required |
| Growth Lead | Required | Required | Required | Required |
| Product Lead | Optional | Required | Optional | Required |
| Ops / PMO | Required | Required | Required | Required |
| Finance Owner | Optional | Optional | Optional | Required (if pricing changes) |
| Legal/Compliance | Optional | Optional | Optional | Required (if policy changes) |

---

## Escalation Triggers

Escalate to leadership within 24 hours if:

- A Priority 0 decision remains blocked beyond its due window.
- Canonical pricing changes without downstream doc updates.
- KPI owner is missing for any core funnel metric.
- More than 5 experiments are running concurrently.
- Two consecutive weekly reviews have no scale/kill decisions.

---

## Success Criteria for the Cadence

After 4 weeks, this cadence is working if:

- All Priority 0 decisions are closed.
- Contradiction backlog is reduced to zero open critical items.
- Every weekly meeting produces explicit decisions and owners.
- Strategy docs remain synchronized with decision log entries.
