## Escalation Rules

- Any missed Priority 0 decision date delays expansion work.
- Any unresolved pricing contradiction blocks launch messaging updates.
- Any unowned KPI blocks channel scaling decisions.

## Completion Criteria

Calendar is complete when:

- All Priority 0 decisions are closed with owner/date.
- One path worksheet is signed.
- Contradictions across strategy docs are reconciled.
- Weekly KPI and experiment cadence is active.
