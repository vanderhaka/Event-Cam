## Alignment Operations Terms

## Priority 0 Decision
A path-defining decision that must be closed before expansion initiatives proceed.

## Decision Closure
A decision marked closed only when owner/date are logged and affected docs are synced.

## Superseded Decision
A previously closed decision replaced by a newer one, archived with rationale and evidence.

## Alignment Score
Weekly 0–20 score from `ALIGNMENT-SCORECARD.md` indicating alignment health.

## Documentation Sync SLA
Expected time (48 hours) to update affected docs after a closed decision.

## Active Artifact Set
The explicitly declared list of artifacts currently used as operational sources in the active cycle.

## Frozen Artifact
An artifact retained for history/context but excluded from current-cycle operational use.

## Canonical Source
The primary source-of-truth artifact for a given operating domain.

## Canonical Conflict
A contradiction where two artifacts claim source-of-truth status for the same domain.

## Operating Mode
The current governance intensity profile (Focus, Execution, Governance, or Diagnostic).

## System Health Band
Weekly meta-health classification (Green/Yellow/Red) representing alignment-discipline quality.

## Data-Ready Status
Weekly contract outcome indicating whether critical fields are valid enough for non-provisional decisions.

## Weekly Data Contract
Minimum required critical fields, freshness rules, and validation outcomes for weekly review readiness.

## ID Hygiene
The quality of identifier consistency (format, uniqueness, cross-linking) across all operational artifacts.

## State Transition Integrity
Conformance of status changes to the approved state-machine transition rules.

## Decision Premortem
Structured pre-approval analysis that assumes decision failure and identifies likely causes, warnings, and controls.

## Owner Load Risk
Workload concentration level (Low/Medium/High) for a specific owner based on active critical alignment responsibilities.

## Decision Intake Queue
Canonical front-door list where new decision requests are logged, triaged, and routed before scheduling and closure.

## Decision WIP Limit
Maximum allowed number of concurrently active decisions by priority band to protect decision quality and SLA reliability.

## Decision Outcome Review
Structured post-close evaluation that compares intended decision effects with observed results and determines reinforcement, modification, or reversal actions.

## Meeting Effectiveness Status
Weekly quality rating (Green/Yellow/Red) indicating whether recurring alignment meetings are producing sufficient decisions, closures, and synchronized artifact updates.

## Commitment Slippage
Condition where a weekly commitment misses due date, fails agreed quality gate, or remains unsynchronized across required artifacts.

## Artifact Utilization Rate
Percentage of declared active artifacts that are actually referenced in weekly operating workflows.

## Control Sunset
Formal process for merging or retiring an active governance control only after risk stability evidence and approval checks are satisfied.

## Decision Confidence Score
Composite 0–100 score indicating how strongly a decision is supported across evidence strength, causal clarity, execution readiness, and risk containment.

## Calibration Gap
Difference between expected decision outcome (based on confidence band) and observed outcome, used to detect scoring bias over time.

## Evidence Expiry
State where previously valid evidence is no longer current enough to support high-impact decision approvals under defined refresh cadences.

## Override
Time-bounded exception to a standard control rule, allowed only with explicit rationale, risk owner, and compensating control.

## Governance Cost
Total weekly time spent on meetings, documentation, control administration, and governance-related recovery work.

## Control Portfolio Review
Periodic assessment of all active controls to decide keep/merge/retire/expand actions based on risk coverage, usage, and cost.

## Governance ROI Index
Normalized monthly measure of governance benefit minus governance cost, used to assess whether process intensity is producing net execution value.

## Control Precedence
Rule hierarchy that determines which control wins when two active controls prescribe conflicting actions.

---

## Incident & Escalation Terms

## Alignment Incident
Any event that materially threatens path execution, decision quality, metric trust, or canonical consistency.

## Severity (Sev-1 to Sev-4)
Incident urgency classification used to determine response and escalation timing.

## On-Call Owner
The person accountable for immediate incident response under the escalation matrix.

## Escalation Playcard
A scenario-specific response runbook defining immediate, 24-hour, and 72-hour actions.

## Hotwash
A structured post-incident learning review completed within 48 hours of stabilization.

## Stabilization Window
The target duration to contain incident impact and restore minimum control integrity.

## Metric Anomaly (A1/A2/A3)
Unexpected KPI behavior classified by severity for triage urgency and decision-gating impact.

## Usage Rule

If teams use different meanings for any term in this glossary, pause reporting and reconcile definitions before making decisions.
