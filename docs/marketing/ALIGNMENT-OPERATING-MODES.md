# Alignment Operating Modes

Use this artifact to run the alignment system in a mode that matches current business conditions.

Not every week should run with the same level of process intensity.

---

## Purpose

This document defines four operating modes that tune:
- artifact load,
- meeting intensity,
- escalation speed,
- leadership involvement.

It helps teams avoid both over-processing and under-governing.

---

## Mode Definitions

### 1) **Focus Mode** (stabilize and simplify)

Use when:
- team is small or bandwidth-constrained,
- path is newly selected,
- signal quality is still low.

Recommended stack:
- Pack A (+ minimal Pack B essentials only)

Primary objective:
- close critical decisions and execute one clear path.

---

### 2) **Execution Mode** (steady weekly operations)

Use when:
- path is stable,
- weekly cadence is functioning,
- KPI instrumentation is reliable enough for decision support.

Recommended stack:
- Pack B (+ selected Pack C controls)

Primary objective:
- improve execution speed and KPI movement consistency.

---

### 3) **Governance Mode** (risk-sensitive scaling)

Use when:
- cross-functional complexity increases,
- partner/financial/legal risk grows,
- leadership requires stronger auditability.

Recommended stack:
- Pack C (with targeted Pack D controls)

Primary objective:
- prevent drift while scaling team/process complexity.

---

### 4) **Diagnostic Mode** (high uncertainty or recovery)

Use when:
- KPI signals are contradictory or deteriorating,
- decision quality is disputed,
- repeated reversals or contradictions occur.

Recommended stack:
- Full Pack D

Primary objective:
- isolate root causes, restore signal trust, and reset operating confidence.

## Mode Selection Triggers

| Trigger | Suggested Mode |
|---|---|
| First 2–4 weeks after choosing path | Focus Mode |
| Weekly cadence running with manageable risk | Execution Mode |
| New teams/channels/commercial complexity introduced | Governance Mode |
| Off-track KPIs + rising contradictions + decision churn | Diagnostic Mode |

---

## Mode Transition Rules

### Escalate to higher-intensity mode when:
- alignment score falls below threshold for 2 consecutive weeks,
- 2+ critical blockers remain unresolved beyond SLA,
- repeated contradiction or reversal events occur.

### De-escalate to lower-intensity mode when:
- on-time decision close rate recovers,
- KPI signals stabilize for 3+ weeks,
- artifact update latency returns to target.

## Mode Guardrails

1. Declare active mode weekly in `ALIGNMENT-ACTIVE-ARTIFACT-SET.md`.
2. Do not run mixed modes without explicit owner approval.
3. Any mode change must be logged in `ALIGNMENT-CHANGELOG.md`.
4. Reconfirm ownership and cadence after every mode switch.

## Weekly Mode Review Checklist

- [ ] Current mode still matches operating reality.
- [ ] Active artifact count matches mode/pack expectations.
- [ ] Escalation pace is appropriate for current risk level.
- [ ] Leadership decision load is sustainable.
- [ ] Mode change needed? If yes, assign effective date and owner.
