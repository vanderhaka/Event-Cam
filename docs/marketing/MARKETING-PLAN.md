## 1. Executive Summary

Every wedding ends the same way: hundreds of incredible photos trapped on guests' phones, scattered across group chats, or lost entirely. The couple — who spent months planning every detail — ends up with a fraction of the memories from their big day. Existing solutions require guests to download an app or create an account, and participation craters.

Event Cam eliminates that friction entirely. The couple creates their wedding event, adds their guest list, and distributes unique QR codes (table tents, place cards, signage). Guests scan with their phone camera, upload photos and videos in their browser, and they're done — no app, no account, no hassle.

What makes Event Cam special beyond the QR workflow:

- **AI-generated custom watermarks** — The couple provides their names, date, or a monogram, and AI generates a beautiful, one-of-a-kind watermark that's applied to every photo in the album. It's branded to their wedding, not a generic stamp.
- **Photo filters** — Guests (or the couple) can apply curated wedding-friendly filters before or after upload, giving the entire album a cohesive, polished aesthetic without hiring an editor.
- **Full moderation** — Every upload is reviewed before it hits the album. Approve or reject with one tap.
- **Private sharing** — Password-protected album links with optional view limits and expiration.

At **$2 per guest**, a 150-person wedding costs $300 — less than the cake, less than the flowers, less than one hour of photography — but it delivers something no photographer alone can: every angle, every moment, from every guest.

**Built-in growth engine:** Every wedding is also a lead generation event. When guests scan the QR code and upload, Event Cam captures their email address. A 150-person wedding gives you 150 warm leads — people in the same age/life-stage demographic who just had a positive experience with the product. Many of them are engaged themselves, planning events, or will be soon. This turns every single wedding into a marketing channel that pays for itself.

**Core marketing thesis:** Position Event Cam as the modern replacement for disposable cameras and wedding photo apps. Lead with the emotional hook ("every memory from every guest"), differentiate on AI watermarks and filters, and leverage the guest email flywheel to drive compounding organic growth.

## 2. Target Audience

### Primary Segment: Weddings & Private Celebrations

| Sub-Segment | Description | Guest Count | Revenue @ $2/guest | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Engaged couples (DIY)** | Couples planning their own wedding | 50–200 | $100–$400 | Largest volume; $2/head is trivial in a wedding budget |
| **Birthday parties** | Milestone birthdays, surprise parties, kids' parties | 20–100 | $49–$200 | High volume; natural word-of-mouth from attendees |
| **Engagement parties & showers** | Pre-wedding events | 20–80 | $49–$160 | Funnel into the wedding itself — if they use Event Cam for the engagement, they'll use it for the wedding |
| **Wedding planners** | Professional planners managing multiple weddings/year | 100–300 | $200–$600 per event | Repeat buyers; recommend tools to every client |
| **Destination weddings** | Smaller guest list, but high-value experience | 20–80 | $49–$160 | Especially value "no app download" since guests may have limited connectivity |
| **Large/cultural weddings** | Indian, Nigerian, Filipino, etc. — often 300–500+ guests | 300–500+ | $600–$1,000+ | Highest per-event revenue; strong community word-of-mouth |
| **Anniversaries & vow renewals** | Milestone celebrations with similar dynamics to weddings | 20–150 | $49–$300 | Same product, same price, organic expansion |

### Secondary Segments (Future Expansion)

| Segment | Description | Opportunity |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Wedding photographers** | Use Event Cam as a guest-photo supplement alongside their professional shots | Power users who bring repeat business; natural referral channel |
| **Corporate events** | Holiday parties, retreats, conferences | Future segment once primary brand is established |

### Buyer Persona: "Soon-to-Be Sarah"

- 26–35 years old, recently engaged, 8–14 months out from the wedding
- Deep in wedding planning mode — reading The Knot, scrolling WeddingTok, pinning on Pinterest
- Already overwhelmed by decisions; wants tools that are simple and "just work"
- Hates the idea of asking 150 guests to download yet another app
- Loves the idea of a custom watermark with their names and date on every photo
- Budget-conscious but understands $2/guest ($300 total) is nothing compared to the photographer ($3,000+), the venue ($10,000+), or even the cake ($500+)
- Will absolutely share the product with her engaged friends if it works well

### Buyer Persona: "Planner Priya"

- 30–50 years old, professional wedding planner managing 15–40 weddings/year
- Always looking for tools that make her look good to clients
- Values reliability and polish — she's recommending this to paying clients
- Sees AI watermarks and filters as a "wow" feature she can showcase in proposals
- $2/guest is easy to pass through to the client or absorb as a business expense
- If she likes Event Cam, she brings 15–40 events/year of recurring revenue

## 3. Value Proposition & Messaging

### One-Liner

> **Every guest. Every photo. Your watermark. No app required.**

### Elevator Pitch

Event Cam is the easiest way to collect photos and videos from every guest at your wedding. Put QR codes on tables, guests scan with their phone and upload — no app, no account, no friction. AI generates a custom watermark with your names and wedding date that's applied to every photo. Add beautiful filters for a cohesive look. Moderate everything, build curated albums, and share with password-protected links. All for just $2 per guest.

### Messaging Pillars

| Pillar | Message | Proof Point |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Zero friction** | "Scan. Upload. Done." — Your guests never download an app or create an account | Browser-based upload; works on any phone with a camera |
| **AI watermarks** | "Your names. Your date. On every photo." — AI generates a custom, beautiful watermark unique to your wedding | One-of-a-kind AI-generated design, not a generic text stamp |
| **Filters & polish** | "A cohesive album without an editor." — Curated filters give every guest's photos a unified, polished look | Wedding-friendly filter presets applied in-browser or post-upload |
| **Full control** | "Your wedding, your album." — Review every photo before anyone sees it | Built-in approve/reject moderation queue |
| **Privacy-first** | "Private by default." — No public galleries, no social media leaks | Password-protected links with view limits and expiration |
| **Premium yet affordable** | "Less than a dollar per memory." — $2/guest is still cheaper than disposable cameras and a fraction of a photo booth | 150 guests = $300; compare to $500+ photo booth or $300+ in disposable cameras |

### Tagline Options

- "Every guest. Every photo. Your watermark."
- "The wedding album that fills itself."
- "Scan. Upload. Done. — $2 per guest."
- "No app. No friction. Every memory."
- "AI-watermarked. Guest-powered. Beautifully yours."

### Emotional Hook (for Ads & Landing Pages)

> Your photographer captures 500 perfect shots. Your 150 guests capture 2,000 more — the candid laughs, the dance floor chaos, the moments between moments. Event Cam collects them all, watermarks them with your names, and puts them in one beautiful album. For two dollars a guest.

## 4. Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses | Event Cam Advantage |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| **The Guest** (app) | Polished UI, established brand | Requires app download; $100+/event pricing; no AI features | No download + AI watermarks + filters + competitive pricing ($2/guest) |
| **WedUploader** | Wedding-focused | Limited features; dated UI | AI watermarks, filters, modern UX, simpler pricing |
| **Disposable cameras** | Nostalgia, tactile experience | $15–$30 each × 10–20 tables = $150–$600; low quality; development delay | Instant digital, higher quality, cheaper at scale, plus AI watermarks |
| **Google Photos shared album** | Free, familiar | Requires Google account; no moderation; no watermarks; no privacy controls; messy at 100+ contributors | Moderation + watermarks + filters + password-protected sharing |
| **Wedding hashtag (Instagram)** | Zero setup | Public; no control; buried in feed; no curation; guests forget to use it | Private, curated, QR-driven (no one forgets to scan a table card) |
| **WhatsApp/iMessage group** | Everyone has it | Compressed images; chaotic; no curation; no watermarks; maxes out fast | Full-resolution uploads, organized albums, AI watermarks |
| **Motif / Chatbooks** | Print-focused albums | Require manual upload; no guest collection workflow | Collect first, print later (future upsell) |

**Positioning:** Event Cam is the modern disposable camera — but digital, instant, AI-watermarked, and a fraction of the price. No other solution combines zero-friction QR collection, AI-generated watermarks, photo filters, moderation, and private sharing in one product for $2/guest.

### Differentiation Matrix

| Feature | Event Cam | The Guest | Disposable Cameras | Google Photos | Instagram Hashtag |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| No app download | Yes | No | N/A | No (need account) | No (need account) |
| AI custom watermarks | Yes | No | No | No | No |
| Photo filters | Yes | Limited | No | No | Yes (but public) |

## 5. Pricing Strategy

### Core Model: $2 Per Guest ($49 Minimum)

| Example Wedding | Guests | Total Price | Context |
|----------------|--------|-------------|---------|
| Intimate / destination | 25 | $49 (minimum) | Less than a single centerpiece |
| Mid-size | 100 | $200 | Less than the cake topper |
| Large | 150 | $300 | Less than the cake |
| Grand / cultural | 400 | $800 | Still less than one hour of photography |

### Why $2/Guest Works

- **Dead simple** — No tiers to compare, no feature matrix to decode. "Two dollars per guest."
- **Scales naturally** — Larger weddings pay more, which is fair because they generate more media, use more storage, and get more value.
- **Premium but accessible** — $300 for a 150-guest wedding feels like a real product, not a giveaway. Still less than the cake, the flowers, or one hour of photography.
- **$49 minimum sets the floor** — Even small events feel like a meaningful purchase. Prevents micro-transactions and signals quality.
- **Easy for planners to quote** — "It's two dollars per guest" is something a planner can say in a consultation without pulling up a pricing page.
- **Aligns with current Stripe checkout** — Already built to charge per invite count.

### Minimum & Maximum

- **Minimum charge:** $49 (positions the product as premium, covers costs)
- **No maximum:** Let it scale. A 500-person wedding at $1,000 is still a fraction of the total budget.

### Free Trial

- Allow one event with up to **10 guests** for free
- Full feature set including AI watermarks and filters — no feature gating
- Purpose: let engaged couples try it at a bridal shower or engagement party, then convert for the wedding
- This also lets wedding planners test before recommending to clients

### What's Included at $2/Guest (Everything)

- Unlimited photo and video uploads from guests
- AI-generated custom watermark (names, date, monogram — couple's choice)
- Full filter library for guests and couple
- Moderation dashboard (approve/reject)
- Curated albums with password-protected sharing
- QR code generation for all guests
- Guest email capture
- 12-month album hosting (media stays live for a year after the event)

### Future Premium Add-Ons (Upsell Opportunities)

| Add-On | Price Idea | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Extended hosting** | $3/month after 12 months | Keep albums live beyond the included year |
| **Photobook ordering** | $40–$80 | Partner with print-on-demand; one-click from the album |
| **AI slideshow / highlight reel** | $19 | Auto-generate a video montage from the best uploads |
| **Custom filter creation** | $9 | Couple designs their own filter (color grade, grain, etc.) |
| **Premium watermark pack** | $5 | AI generates 10+ watermark options in premium styles |
| **Full-resolution export** | $9 | Download all originals in a ZIP |
| **White-label for Pros** | $49/month | Remove Event Cam branding; Pro's logo instead |

### Revenue Projections (Conservative)

| Metric | Phase 1 (Mo 1–3) | Phase 2 (Mo 3–6) | Phase 3 (Mo 6–12) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Weddings / month | 30 | 150 | 500 |
| Avg guests / wedding | 120 | 130 | 140 |
| Revenue / month | $7,200 | $39,000 | $140,000 |
| Upsell revenue (est. 10%) | $720 | $3,900 | $14,000 |
| **Total / month** | **$7,920** | **$42,900** | **$154,000** |

## 6. Go-to-Market Channels

### Organic / Low-Cost Channels

#### SEO & Content Marketing
- Target long-tail wedding keywords: "collect wedding photos from guests," "wedding photo QR code," "disposable camera alternative wedding," "wedding photo watermark"
- Create blog content around wedding planning with natural product placement
- Build comparison pages: "Event Cam vs. Disposable Cameras," "Event Cam vs. The Guest App"
- Target the "AI wedding" trend: "AI watermark for wedding photos," "AI wedding photo filter"

#### Social Media (Organic)
- **Instagram:** Before/after filter demos, watermark reveal videos, real wedding album showcases
- **TikTok / Reels:** "POV: You're a wedding guest and there's a QR code on the table..." — show the 15-second scan-to-upload experience. These are inherently viral because weddings are emotional and everyone relates.
- **Pinterest:** Wedding QR code table setup ideas, watermark design inspiration, wedding album aesthetic boards. Pinterest is *the* wedding planning platform — heavy investment here.
- **YouTube Shorts:** Quick tutorials — "How to set up Event Cam for your wedding in 2 minutes"

#### WeddingTok & Bridal Content Creators
- The wedding planning niche on TikTok is enormous. Partner with creators who post wedding tips, DIY wedding content, and budget breakdowns.
- "$2 per guest" is a great hook for budget-focused wedding content: "I spent $300 and got 2,000 photos from my guests — here's how."

#### Product Hunt Launch
- Lead with the AI watermark angle — it's novel and visual
- Prepare a side-by-side demo: generic shared album vs. Event Cam with watermarks and filters

#### Community Engagement
- **r/weddingplanning** (1.3M members) — Offer genuine advice, share the product when relevant
- **r/Weddingsunder10k** — $2/guest is still a budget-friendly pitch ($300 for 150 guests vs. $500+ photo booth)
- **The Knot / WeddingWire forums** — Engaged couples actively asking "how do I collect guest photos?"
- **Facebook groups:** "Wedding Planning Tips & Ideas," "Budget Brides," local wedding planning groups
- **Bridal shows / expos:** Physical presence where engaged couples are actively shopping for vendors

### Paid Channels (Phase 2+)

#### Google Ads
- High-intent keywords: "wedding guest photo app," "QR code wedding photos," "wedding photo collection," "disposable camera alternative"
- Expected CPC: $1.50–$4.00 (wedding keywords are competitive but high-intent)
- Target CAC under $20 (a 150-guest wedding returns $150, so $20 CAC = strong payback)

#### Meta Ads (Instagram / Facebook)
- **Audience:** Recently engaged (Facebook knows this — it's a declared life event), ages 24–38, interests in wedding planning, The Knot, Zola, etc.
- **Creative concepts:**
  - Split-screen: "The group chat" (chaos, compressed images) vs. "The Event Cam album" (organized, watermarked, beautiful)
  - Watermark reveal: Show a plain photo, then the AI watermark fades in with the couple's names and date
  - Filter before/after: Same guest photo, raw vs. with a warm wedding filter
  - Price anchor: "Your photographer costs $4,000. Your guest photos cost $2 each."
- Retarget website visitors who started signup but didn't create an event

#### Pinterest Ads
- Pinterest is the #1 wedding planning tool. Promoted pins in "wedding ideas," "wedding reception," "wedding photos" categories.
- Visual-first platform is perfect for showcasing watermarked albums and filter aesthetics.

#### Influencer / Creator Partnerships
- Micro-influencers in the wedding space (10k–100k followers)
- Offer free events in exchange for honest content showing Event Cam at a real wedding
- Focus on wedding photographers who supplement with guest photos — they'll show real results to a trusted audience

## 7. Guest Email Flywheel

This is Event Cam's most powerful — and most cost-efficient — growth channel. Every single wedding generates a list of warm, high-quality email leads at zero incremental acquisition cost.

### How It Works

1. **Couple creates a wedding** and adds their guest list (names + emails, or just names with QR distribution)
2. **Guests scan the QR code** at the wedding and land on the upload page
3. **Before uploading, the guest enters their email** (required — framed as "so we can send you the album link")
4. **Guest uploads photos/videos**, has a great experience, and leaves with a positive impression of Event Cam
5. **Post-wedding, the guest receives the album link** via email — this is the value delivery moment
6. **Follow-up emails** nurture the guest toward their own future use: "Planning an event? Your first 10 guests are free."

### Why This Is So Valuable

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Volume** | A single 150-guest wedding = 150 emails. 50 weddings/month = 7,500 new emails/month. 200 weddings/month = 30,000 new emails/month. |
| **Quality** | These aren't cold leads. They've used the product, had a positive experience, and are in a life stage where events (and weddings) are common. |
| **Demographic match** | Wedding guests skew 24–40, the exact demographic that's getting engaged, throwing parties, and planning events. A meaningful % are themselves engaged or will be within 1–2 years. |
| **Warm introduction** | The guest's first interaction with Event Cam was fun (taking photos at a wedding) and useful (getting the album link). There's built-in goodwill. |
| **Zero marginal cost** | You're not paying for these leads. They come as a natural byproduct of the product working. |
| **Compounding** | Every new wedding generates guests who become future couples who generate more guests. This is a true flywheel. |

### The Math

| Scenario | Weddings/Mo | Avg Guests | Emails Captured (80% rate) | Annual Email List Growth |
|----------|------------|------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Phase 1 | 50 | 120 | 4,800/mo | ~57,600/yr |
| Phase 2 | 200 | 130 | 20,800/mo | ~249,600/yr |
| Phase 3 | 500 | 140 | 56,000/mo | ~672,000/yr |

Even a conservative 2% conversion rate on guest-to-couple (guest eventually plans their own wedding and uses Event Cam) means:
- Phase 1: ~96 new wedding customers/year from guest emails alone
- Phase 2: ~4,992 new wedding customers/year
- Phase 3: ~13,440 new wedding customers/year

At $260 average revenue per wedding ($2/guest × 130 avg guests), Phase 3 guest email conversion alone = **$3.5M/year in revenue** from a channel that costs essentially nothing.

### Email Capture UX

The email capture must feel natural, not extractive. Key principles:

- **Frame it as value for the guest:** "Enter your email so we can send you the album when it's ready." This is genuinely useful — the guest *wants* to see the final album.
- **Ask at the right moment:** After the QR scan, before the upload. The guest is already committed to participating. The email field is a small ask at a high-intent moment.
- **Keep it fast:** Name + email, nothing else. One field if possible (email only), two fields max.
- **Confirm with value:** Immediately after upload, show: "Thanks! We'll email you the album link when [Couple Name] shares it."
- **Respect opt-out:** Include a clear "marketing emails" checkbox (unchecked by default in EU/GDPR regions, checked by default in US with clear opt-out). The album delivery email is transactional and doesn't require opt-in.

### Guest Email Sequences

**Sequence 1: Album Delivery (Transactional — sent to all guests)**

| Timing | Email | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| When album is shared | "The photos from [Couple]'s wedding are ready!" | Deliver album link; re-engage with product |
| Album + 3 days | "Did you see your photos? [X] guests contributed [Y] photos" | Drive album views; social proof |

**Sequence 2: Guest-to-Customer Nurture (Marketing — opt-in only)**

| Timing | Email | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Post-wedding + 2 weeks | "Loved being part of [Couple]'s wedding album? Here's what Event Cam does." | Soft product introduction; brand awareness |
| + 1 month | "Planning a birthday, party, or event? Your first 10 guests are free." | Low-pressure conversion offer |
| + 3 months | "Getting engaged? Here's how couples are using Event Cam at their weddings." | Target the engaged subset; show social proof |
| + 6 months | "Anniversary coming up? Collect photos from friends and family." | Re-engage around milestone events |
| Engagement season (Dec–Feb) | "Just got engaged? Congrats! Here's a wedding planning hack your guests will love." | Seasonal push timed to peak engagement season |

**Sequence 3: Referral Ask (Marketing — opt-in only)**

| Timing | Email | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Post-wedding + 1 month | "Know someone getting married? Share Event Cam and you both get $10 off." | Referral program activation |
| Every 3 months | "Still planning events? $10 referral credit is waiting." | Referral reminder |

### Segmentation Strategy

Not all guest emails are equal. Segment for higher-conversion targeting:

| Segment | How to Identify | Marketing Angle |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Guests who uploaded 3+ photos** | Upload count | High engagement — they loved the product. Strongest conversion candidates. |
| **Guests who viewed the album multiple times** | Album page analytics | Emotionally invested in the content. Warm lead for "create your own event." |
| **Guests in the 24–34 age range** | Inferred from couple's guest list metadata (if available) or self-reported | Prime wedding-planning demographic. Target with engagement/wedding content. |
| **Guests who clicked a referral link** | Click tracking | Already considering Event Cam. Send conversion-focused follow-up. |
| **Guests from large weddings (200+)** | Event metadata | Likely part of communities where large events are common. Cultural/community targeting. |

### Long-Term Email List Value

The guest email list becomes one of Event Cam's most valuable assets over time:

- **Direct marketing channel** with near-zero cost (email is essentially free at scale with tools like Resend, Postmark, or SendGrid)
- **Lookalike audiences** — Upload the email list to Meta/Google to build lookalike audiences for paid ads. Wedding guests look like future wedding customers.
- **Seasonal campaigns** — Every December–February (peak engagement season), blast the list with "Just got engaged?" content.
- **Product launches** — When you launch new features (photobooks, AI slideshows, filters), the guest list is the first audience to notify.
- **Network effects** — As the list grows, you can partner with wedding vendors (venues, planners, photographers) to do co-marketing, because you have a massive, verified list of people who attend weddings.

| Friday | TikTok | Budget wedding tips: "$2 per guest for every photo from your wedding" |
| Saturday | Instagram Stories | Real couple testimonial / album preview (with permission) |

### Key Video Concepts (TikTok / Reels / Shorts)

1. **"The QR Scan"** — Film a guest at a real wedding scanning the QR, uploading a photo, done in 10 seconds. Add text: "No app. No account. Just scan."
2. **"The Watermark Reveal"** — Show a plain wedding photo, then the AI watermark fades in with the couple's names. Satisfying visual moment.
3. **"$2 vs. $30"** — Side by side: disposable camera on a table ($30 per table) vs. Event Cam QR card ($2 per guest). Show the quality difference.
4. **"The Morning After"** — Couple wakes up the day after the wedding, opens Event Cam, and scrolls through 1,500 guest photos they've never seen. Emotional.
5. **"Filter Glow-Up"** — Grid of raw guest phone photos → apply a warm wedding filter → instant cohesive album.

### Email Sequences

1. **Welcome sequence** (post-signup, 5 emails over 2 weeks):
   - Email 1: Welcome + how Event Cam works (video walkthrough)

## 12. Budget Guidance

### Phase 1 Budget (Monthly, Months 1–3)

| Category | Monthly Spend | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Content creation (blog, social, Pinterest) | $500–$1,000 | Freelance writers, wedding-focused design assets |
| Product Hunt prep | $300 (one-time) | Demo video production with watermark reveal |
| Community outreach | $0 (time cost) | Founder-led Reddit/Facebook/wedding forum engagement |
| Micro-influencer seeding | $500–$800 | Free events + small fees for 5–10 wedding creators |
| AI / compute costs (watermark generation) | $100–$200 | Image generation API costs during beta |
| Email platform (guest sequences) | $50–$100 | Resend, Postmark, or SendGrid — low volume in Phase 1 |
| **Total** | **$1,450–$2,400/mo** | |

### Phase 2 Budget (Monthly, Months 3–8)

| Category | Monthly Spend | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Google Ads | $2,000–$4,000 | Wedding-intent search campaigns |
| Meta Ads (Instagram / Facebook) | $1,500–$3,000 | Targeting recently engaged couples |
| Pinterest Ads | $500–$1,500 | Promoted pins in wedding categories |
| Content creation | $1,000–$2,000 | Scaled blog, video, Pinterest content |
| Influencer partnerships | $1,000–$2,500 | Ongoing wedding creator program |
| Bridal show booths | $500–$1,500 | 1–2 shows/month in peak season (amortized) |
| AI / compute costs | $300–$600 | Scales with wedding volume |
| Email platform (guest nurture at scale) | $200–$500 | 20k+ emails/month; Resend or SendGrid growth tier |
| **Total** | **$7,000–$15,600/mo** | |

### Budget Context

At Phase 2 targets of 200 weddings/month averaging $260/wedding ($2 × 130 guests), that's $52,000/month in revenue. Even at the high end of the budget ($15,600), marketing spend is 30% of revenue — healthy for a growth-stage consumer product. As organic channels compound and referrals kick in, paid spend as a % of revenue should drop to 15–25% by month 8.

## 13. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Low guest participation** (guests don't scan QR) | High — product value depends on uploads | Medium | Provide couples with QR placement guides, printable table tent templates, and DJ announcement scripts; make QR impossible to miss; follow-up email to guests post-ceremony |
| **AI watermark quality** | High — if watermarks look generic or bad, it undermines the premium feel | Medium | Offer multiple AI-generated options per couple; allow manual adjustment; iterate on prompts and models based on satisfaction scores |
| **Wedding seasonality** | Medium — revenue heavily concentrated in May–October | High | Target destination/winter weddings in off-season; expand into engagement parties, bridal showers, anniversaries; launch corporate event push in Q4 |
| **Privacy concerns** | High — collecting photos involves consent | Medium | Mandatory consent screen before upload (already built); clear privacy policy; GDPR compliance for international weddings |
| **Competitor copies AI watermark feature** | Medium — AI features are easy to replicate | Medium | Build brand loyalty fast; invest in watermark quality and variety; layer on additional AI features (slideshow, auto-curation); build planner/photographer network effects |
| **$2/guest feels expensive for small weddings** | Low — a 25-person dinner is $49 (minimum) | Low | $49 minimum positions the product as premium; free tier for 10 guests lets them try first; $49 is still cheaper than almost any wedding vendor |
| **AI compute costs spike** | Medium — image generation costs could erode margins | Low | Cache watermark designs (one generation per wedding, applied to all photos); use efficient models; watermark is a one-time generation, not per-photo AI |
| **Storage costs at scale (video-heavy uploads)** | Low — margins compress if guests upload lots of video | Medium | Set per-event storage caps (e.g., 10GB included); compress/transcode uploads; offer extended storage as paid add-on |
| **Guest email spam perception** | Medium — guests feel spammed after uploading at a wedding | Medium | Keep nurture emails infrequent (max 1/month); always lead with value (album link, photos); prominent unsubscribe; never sell the list to third parties |
| **GDPR / CAN-SPAM compliance for guest emails** | High — legal risk if email capture isn't compliant | Medium | Separate transactional (album delivery) from marketing emails; require opt-in for marketing in EU/UK; include clear privacy policy on upload page; honor unsubscribes instantly |
| **Low guest email capture rate** | Medium — guests skip the email field or use fake addresses | Low | Frame email as "so we can send you the album" (genuine value); validate email format; consider optional SMS alternative |

## Appendix: AI Watermark & Filter Feature — Marketing Notes

### AI Watermark as a Marketing Differentiator

The AI-generated custom watermark is not just a feature — it's the single most marketable differentiator Event Cam has. Here's why:

- **Visual and shareable:** A beautiful watermark on a wedding photo is inherently Instagram/Pinterest/TikTok content. Couples will screenshot their watermark design and share it. This is free organic marketing.
- **Emotional:** The watermark has the couple's names and wedding date. It transforms a random guest phone photo into a personalized wedding keepsake.
- **Novel:** No competitor offers AI-generated watermarks. "The Guest" and similar apps have generic branding at best.
- **Proof of value:** When a couple sees the watermark on their photos, they immediately feel they got their money's worth. It's the visible manifestation of what they paid for.

### How to Talk About Watermarks in Marketing

- Don't say "watermark" in isolation — it sounds like stock photo protection. Say **"custom AI watermark"** or **"personalized wedding watermark."**
- Show, don't tell: every ad, every social post, every landing page should show a real photo with a beautiful watermark. The watermark sells itself visually.
- Position it as a "keepsake" or "signature" — "Every photo from your wedding, signed with your names."

### Filter Feature as a Secondary Hook

Filters are table stakes in the photo app world, but for wedding guest photos they serve a specific purpose:

- **Cohesion:** 150 guests with 150 different phone cameras and lighting conditions = wildly inconsistent album. A shared filter gives the whole collection a unified aesthetic.
- **Quality uplift:** Guest phone photos are often mediocre. A good filter makes them look intentionally stylistic rather than accidentally bad.
- **Fun for guests:** If guests can apply a filter during upload, it makes the experience more interactive and fun — increasing participation.

### Filter Marketing Angle

- "Your guests' phones are all different. Your album doesn't have to be."
- "One filter. Every phone. One beautiful, cohesive album."
- Before/after comparisons are extremely effective on social media.
