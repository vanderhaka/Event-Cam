# Next Steps: Pre-Launch Validation Checklist

> Purpose: The 5 things that must happen before any marketing spend, Pro outreach, or growth work begins. These are ordered by priority and designed for a side-project founder with 10-20 hours/week.
>
> Created: 2026-02-15
> Context: Output of the P1-12 assumption register review and founder interview. All strategy docs are comprehensive but built on unvalidated assumptions. These 5 steps convert assumptions into evidence.

## Step 1: Finish the MVP (Album/Gallery View)

**Why this is #1:** Event creation, QR generation, and photo upload all work. But without the album/gallery view, the product can't deliver its core promise. No one can test it, no one can experience the "morning after" moment, and no assumptions can be validated.

**What "done" looks like:**
- A couple creates an event and gets a QR code
- Guests scan the QR code, land on a browser page, and upload photos (already working)
- Uploaded photos appear in a shared album/gallery that the couple (and optionally guests) can view
- The couple can access their album via a link (email delivery is nice-to-have, not required for MVP)
- Basic photo grid layout — no filters, no AI watermarks, no moderation queue needed for v1

**What to explicitly SKIP for MVP:**
- AI watermarks — add after first real test
- Photo filters — add after first real test
- Moderation/approval queue — add after first real test (let all photos through for now)
- Email capture at upload — make the upload completely frictionless for v1
- Pro accounts, dashboards, credit systems — not until Pro interviews are done
- Email sequences (album delivery, nurture) — manual email with a link is fine for first 5 events
- Payment/checkout — can be manual (Stripe payment link or invoice) for first 5 events
- Analytics/tracking — you'll observe directly at test events

**Estimated effort:** 20-40 hours depending on complexity of the gallery view

**Definition of done:** You can hand someone a QR code, they upload a photo, and you can send them a link where they see all the photos from the event in a clean gallery.

**Target:** Complete within 2-3 weeks (at 10-20 hrs/week)

---

## Step 2: Test at One Real Event

**Why this matters:** One real test at one real event will tell you more than every strategy document combined. It validates or invalidates: guest upload rates (GUEST-1), QR scanning behavior (GUEST-4), upload flow friction (GUEST-3), photo quality/quantity expectations, and whether the "morning after" moment actually feels magical or disappointing.

**How to do it:**
1. Pick an event — a birthday party, dinner with friends, engagement party, BBQ, anything with 15+ people. Doesn't need to be a wedding.
2. Print QR codes (even on regular paper taped to tables — no fancy table tents needed)
3. Give minimal instructions — just the QR codes and maybe one verbal mention ("scan this to share photos from tonight")
4. Do NOT hover, explain, or troubleshoot during the event — observe naturally
5. After the event, send participants the album link

**What to measure:**
- How many people were at the event? (total guests)
- How many scanned the QR code? (unique page visits)
- How many actually uploaded at least one photo? (unique uploaders)
- How many photos total were uploaded?
- Average photos per uploader
- Did anyone try to upload video? What happened?
- Did anyone ask for help or seem confused?
- Did anyone mention it unprompted after the event?
- How did the album feel the next morning — exciting, disappointing, sparse?

**What to write down after:**
- Guest participation rate: uploaders / total guests = ___%
- Photos per guest (uploaders only): total photos / uploaders = ___
- Biggest friction point observed: ___
- Biggest surprise (positive or negative): ___
- Would you pay $2/guest for this experience? (ask 3-5 attendees honestly)

**Success criteria:**
- 25%+ of guests uploaded at least one photo = promising (40-50% target may be achievable with optimization)
- 15-24% = needs work on distribution/prompting but core product works
- Under 15% = fundamental product or distribution problem to solve before anything else

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 hours of prep, the event itself, 1-2 hours of analysis after

**Target:** Within 1-2 weeks of MVP completion

## Step 3: Talk to 10 Wedding Professionals

**Why this matters:** The entire primary growth loop (P0-4 decision: Pro network) is built on the assumption that wedding photographers, planners, and other vendors will adopt and recommend Event Cam. Zero professionals have been contacted. This is the biggest blind spot in the strategy. 10 honest conversations will validate or invalidate the Pro growth loop before you build any Pro infrastructure.

**Who to talk to:**
- 4-5 wedding photographers (the primary Pro segment)
- 3-4 wedding planners/coordinators
- 1-2 other vendors (DJ, celebrant, florist) for variety

**Where to find them (AU-focused):**
- Instagram: Search #weddingphotographermelbourne (or your city), #australianweddingphotographer, #weddingplanneraustralia
- Facebook groups: "Australian Wedding Photographers," "Wedding Planners Australia"
- Google: "[your city] wedding photographer" — reach out to ones on page 2-3 (they're less busy and more likely to chat)
- Easy Weddings, WedShed, The Knot AU directories
- Ask friends/family: "Do you know anyone who photographs or plans weddings?"

**How to reach out:**
DM or email template:
> Hi [name], I'm building a tool that lets wedding guests share photos via QR code — no app download needed. I'm not selling anything — I'm trying to understand whether this would actually be useful for photographers/planners. Would you be open to a 15-minute chat? I'd really value your honest take.

**What to ask (in order):**
1. "How do your clients currently handle guest photos? Do they ask guests to share photos after the wedding?" (Understand current behavior)
2. "Have you ever used or recommended a guest photo collection tool? What was the experience?" (Competitive landscape from their perspective)
3. "If a tool existed where guests scan a QR code on the table and upload photos to a shared album — no app download — would that be something you'd mention to clients?" (Core product reaction)
4. Show them a demo or screenshots: "What's your first reaction? What questions would you have?"
5. "If you could buy this at a wholesale rate ($1.20/guest instead of $2) and bundle it into your packages, would you? Or would you prefer to just recommend it and earn a referral credit?" (Path 1 vs Path 2 preference)
6. "If you referred clients and earned credits toward future events, would that motivate you? Or would you prefer cash?" (Credits vs. cash — PRO-3)
7. "If there was a referral program where you get a deeper discount for recruiting other photographers or planners to use it — does that sound appealing or does it feel weird?" (MLM perception test — PRO-2)
8. "What would make you NOT recommend this to a client?" (Objection mining)
9. "How many weddings do you do per year, and what's the average guest count?" (Validate PRO-9 assumptions)
10. "Is there anything I haven't asked that I should know?" (Open-ended gold)

**What to record:**
For each conversation, note:
- Pro type (photographer/planner/DJ/other)
- Weddings per year and avg guest count
- Current guest photo solution (if any)
- Reaction to the product concept (enthusiastic / interested / neutral / skeptical / hostile)
- Path 1 vs Path 2 preference
- Credits vs. cash preference
- MLM reaction (positive / neutral / negative — exact words matter)
- Top objection
- Would they actually use it? (yes / maybe / no)

**Decision triggers:**
- 7+ out of 10 say "yes I'd use/recommend this" → Pro growth loop is validated, build Pro features
- 4-6 out of 10 → promising but needs refinement, dig into objections
- 3 or fewer → Pro growth loop is invalidated, pivot to direct-to-couple acquisition only
- ANY strong negative MLM reaction → simplify to flat referral immediately

**Estimated effort:** 3-5 hours for outreach, 2-3 hours for conversations (15 min each), 1-2 hours to synthesize findings. Total: ~8-10 hours over 2-3 weeks.

**Target:** Run in parallel with Step 1 (MVP build). Start outreach in week 1, have conversations in weeks 2-4.

## Step 4: Sign Up for 3 Competitor Products

**Why this matters:** The competitive analysis in the docs is based on website browsing and an Instagram reel, not hands-on testing. The "no app required" differentiator — the cornerstone of all messaging — hasn't been verified against current competitor flows. Competitors may have already moved to web-based upload. You need to know exactly what you're up against.

**Which competitors to test:**
1. **The Guest** (theguestapp.com) — the most-cited competitor in the docs. Tests the "requires app download" claim.
2. **Joy** (withjoy.com) — wedding planning platform with photo sharing. Tests whether all-in-one platforms offer this feature for free.
3. **One more from search** — search "wedding guest photo QR code no app" and pick the top result you haven't heard of. This finds the competitor you don't know about yet.

**How to test:**
For each competitor:
1. Create a free account / trial
2. Set up a test event
3. Go through the GUEST flow — scan the QR code or click the link as if you're a wedding guest
4. Try to upload a photo
5. See what the album looks like

**What to document for each:**
- Name and URL
- Pricing (free tier? per-guest? flat fee? subscription?)
- Does it require an app download for guests? (THE critical question)
- Guest upload flow: how many steps from link/QR to photo uploaded?
- Is email required from guests?
- Album quality: what does the shared album look like?
- AI features: any watermarks, filters, auto-curation?
- Moderation: can the host approve/reject photos?
- What do they do better than Event Cam?
- What does Event Cam do better?
- Overall impression (1-10)

**Deliverable:** A simple comparison table (even handwritten notes are fine). Update the competitive landscape in MARKETING-PLAN.md Section 4 with real data.

**Decision triggers:**
- If a competitor already offers no-app QR upload → "no app required" is NOT a differentiator, messaging must change
- If competitors are significantly cheaper → pricing strategy needs revisiting
- If a competitor's guest flow is better → study it and learn

**Estimated effort:** 2-4 hours total (under 1 hour per competitor)

**Target:** Complete within 1 week. Can be done in a single evening session.

## Step 5: Build a Cost-to-Serve Model

**Why this matters:** Every pricing decision, Pro discount, and margin calculation in the strategy docs floats without an anchor. The $0.90/guest Pro floor — the minimum Event Cam keeps at the deepest discount — may be unprofitable. Without knowing the actual cost to serve one guest at one event, you can't set prices, evaluate Pro economics, or know if the business works.

**The model (spreadsheet or doc):**

### Per-Event Cost Components

| Component | How to calculate | Est. cost per event (150 guests) |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| **Photo storage** | (avg photos per guest) x (guests) x (avg file size MB) x (Supabase storage $/GB/month) x (12 months hosting) | Calculate from test event data |
| **Video storage** | (avg video clips per guest) x (guests who upload video) x (avg 20s clip size MB) x ($/GB/month) x (12 months) | Calculate from test event data |
| **Bandwidth - upload** | Total upload size x (Supabase bandwidth $/GB) | One-time cost at event time |
| **Bandwidth - album views** | Total album size x (estimated album views over 12 months) x ($/GB) | Recurring over 12 months |
| **Email delivery** | (guests with emails) x (emails per guest: album delivery + optional nurture) x (Resend per-email cost) | Resend: 3,000 free/month, then $1/1,000 |
| **Stripe processing** | Event total x 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction | On a $300 event: ~$9.00 |
| **AI watermark generation** | 1 generation per event x (Gemini Nano API cost per call) | Near-zero if client-side overlay |
| **Supabase compute** | Edge function invocations per event x ($/invocation) | Likely negligible at small scale |

### Key Numbers to Estimate

From your test event (Step 2), you'll know:
- Average photos uploaded per guest
- Average file size per photo
- Whether guests upload video and how much
- Total storage per event

From Supabase pricing:
- Storage: $0.021/GB/month (over 100GB included in Pro)
- Bandwidth: $0.09/GB (over 250GB included in Pro)
- Included in Pro: 100GB storage, 250GB bandwidth

From Resend pricing:
- Free: 3,000 emails/month, 100 emails/day
- Pro: $20/month for 50,000 emails

From Stripe:
- AU: 1.75% + $0.30 AUD (domestic), 2.9% + $0.30 (international)

### Then Calculate Margins

| Scenario | Revenue/guest | Est. cost/guest | Gross margin/guest | Margin % |
|----------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| Retail ($2/guest) | $2.00 | $____ | $____ | ___% |
| Pro wholesale ($1.20/guest) | $1.20 | $____ | $____ | ___% |
| Pro floor ($0.90/guest) | $0.90 | $____ | $____ | ___% |

**Decision triggers:**
- Margin at $0.90/guest > 50% → Pro discount structure is sustainable
- Margin at $0.90/guest is 20-50% → Pro discounts need to be shallower, or the floor raised
- Margin at $0.90/guest < 20% → Pro discount structure is value-destructive, redesign before building
- Margin at $2.00/guest < 70% → Pricing needs to increase or costs need to decrease

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 hours with a spreadsheet. Will be much more accurate after Step 2 (real test event data).

**Target:** Draft model in week 2-3 (using estimates). Refine with real data after Step 2.

## Timeline Overview

```
Week 1-2:   Start MVP build (album/gallery view)
            Start Pro outreach (find and message 10-15 wedding pros)
            Competitor testing (one evening, 2-4 hours)

Week 2-3:   Continue MVP build
            First Pro conversations happening
            Draft cost model (using estimates)

Week 3-4:   Finish MVP
            Continue Pro conversations (aim for 8-10 total)
            Synthesize Pro interview findings

Week 4-5:   MVP done → arrange test event
            Pro interview synthesis complete → decide on Pro features

Week 5-6:   TEST EVENT
            Measure everything
            Refine cost model with real data

Week 6+:    You now have: real usage data, Pro feedback, competitive intel, cost model
            THEN decide: what to build next, whether Pro features are worth it,
            whether pricing is right, whether to rebrand, when to start marketing
```

**Total estimated effort across all 5 steps:** 40-60 hours over 6 weeks (fits within 10-20 hrs/week)

## What This Unlocks

After completing these 5 steps, you will have:

1. **A working product** that real people have used at a real event
2. **Real guest behavior data** (upload rates, photo counts, friction points) replacing every gut-feel number in the strategy docs
3. **Pro validation or invalidation** — you'll know whether the primary growth loop works before building Pro infrastructure
4. **Competitive awareness** — you'll know exactly what you're up against and whether "no app required" is actually a differentiator
5. **Real unit economics** — you'll know your actual margins and whether the pricing structure works

At that point, the 48 assumptions in the ASSUMPTION-REGISTER.md will start converting from "LOW confidence / NOT STARTED" to validated or invalidated. And every decision you make after that will be grounded in evidence, not aspiration.
