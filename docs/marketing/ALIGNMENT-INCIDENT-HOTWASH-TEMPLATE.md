# Alignment Incident Hotwash Template

Use this template immediately after an alignment incident is stabilized to capture lessons while context is fresh.

This is not a blame exercise—it is a system-improvement mechanism.

---

## Purpose

Hotwash output should:
- identify root causes quickly,
- convert observations into prevention actions,
- strengthen future response quality.

---

## When to Run

Run within 48 hours of incident stabilization for:
- all Sev-1 incidents,
- all Sev-2 incidents,
- repeated Sev-3 incidents in same category.

---

## Incident Metadata

- Incident ID:
- Severity:
- Incident type:
- Date/time detected:
- Date/time stabilized:
- Primary on-call owner:
- Participating functions:

## Prevention Actions

| Action | Owner | Due Date | Verification Signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Action 1] | [Owner] | [Date] | [Signal] |
| [Action 2] | [Owner] | [Date] | [Signal] |
| [Action 3] | [Owner] | [Date] | [Signal] |

At least one prevention action must update a control artifact, not just behavior guidance.
