## Priority 0 — Must Answer Immediately (Path-Defining)

## 1) What is the single primary market for the next 6 months?
- **Why this matters:** Prevents split focus across weddings, venues, festivals, and app vision.
- **Decision options:**
  - A) Weddings only
  - B) Weddings + one secondary motion (Pro *or* Venue)
- **Clarity test:** Can you explain this in one sentence?

## 2) What is the canonical live pricing model right now?
- **Why this matters:** Current docs contain conflicting numbers.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Live price table
  - Explicit “not live” pricing assumptions
  - One source-of-truth for pricing assumptions

## 3) What is the final Pro economics model for this phase?
- **Why this matters:** Contradictory commission/margin framing harms partner trust.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Pro-created path economics
  - Referred path economics
  - Coupon/discount logic
  - Payout rules

## 4) What is the one dominant growth loop for this quarter?
- **Why this matters:** Running multiple loops in parallel slows learning.
- **Decision options:**
  - A) Pro partner loop
  - B) Guest flywheel loop
  - C) Content/organic loop
- **Rule:** Pick one primary loop, one secondary support loop max.

## 5) What message architecture is official for this quarter?
- **Why this matters:** Prevents “no app required” vs “social app” narrative conflict.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Core one-liner
  - 3 proof pillars
  - “Not saying yet” boundary list

## 6) What are the non-negotiable legal/compliance rules for guest capture?
- **Why this matters:** Flywheel performance depends on compliant consent and outreach.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Consent policy by region
  - Transactional vs marketing email policy
  - Data retention and deletion policy

## Priority 1 — Needed in the Next 2–4 Weeks

## 7) Which channels are we actively testing, and what is the kill criteria for each?
- **Why this matters:** Avoids channel sprawl.
- **Required outputs:** Scorecard for each active experiment (hypothesis, KPI, pass/fail threshold, stop-loss).

## 8) What is our weekly KPI operating cadence?
- **Why this matters:** Strategy without measurement drifts into opinion.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Weekly metric review person (you)
  - Weekly review meeting
  - Scale / hold / kill decision protocol

## 9) What is the launch playbook timeline and execution responsibility map?
- **Why this matters:** Phases are defined, but day-level operations need accountability.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Week-by-week launch plan
  - Task list with execution order
  - Risk fallback plan

## 10) What is the referral program design (exactly)?
- **Why this matters:** Repeatedly referenced as a growth lever but under-specified.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Incentive structure
  - Attribution window
  - Abuse prevention
  - Financial sustainability threshold

## 11) What is our retention strategy for recurring channels (Pro/Venue)?
- **Why this matters:** Recurring channels can scale fast or churn fast.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Health score definition
  - Churn risk triggers
  - Intervention playbooks

## 12) What assumptions are we treating as facts without evidence?
- **Why this matters:** High-confidence projections can hide fragile assumptions.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Assumption register
  - Confidence level per assumption
  - Validation plan and date

## Priority 2 — Needed Before Broader Expansion

## 13) What has to be true before venue expansion becomes a core motion?
- **Why this matters:** Venue path likely requires different onboarding, retention, and support model.
- **Required outputs:** Minimum qualification metrics and pilot outcomes.

## 14) What has to be true before festival/multi-day is considered active GTM?
- **Why this matters:** Enterprise-style expectations differ substantially from wedding workflows.
- **Required outputs:** Segment-specific validation criteria and ROI case.

## 15) What has to be true before social app build moves from vision to execution?
- **Why this matters:** App work is high effort and can dilute current GTM momentum.
- **Required outputs:** Metric gate thresholds (activation, retention, install intent).

## 16) What naming decision criteria are final?
- **Why this matters:** Naming affects brand rollouts, domain decisions, and messaging consistency.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Legal screen criteria
  - Customer preference criteria
  - Timeline for final selection

## 17) What is our channel-level unit economics baseline by segment?
- **Why this matters:** Spend decisions require comparable CAC/payback across channels.
- **Required outputs:** Standardized channel economics dashboard.

## Decision Ritual (Recommended)

For each question above, capture:

- **Decision:** chosen answer
- **Date decided:** timestamp
- **Implication:** what changes now
- **Docs to update:** which strategy docs must be synced

If any Priority 0 question is unanswered, treat it as an execution blocker for expansion initiatives.

## Decision Log (Fill as Answers Are Finalized)

| Question ID | Decision | Date Decided | Docs to Update | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0-1 | Primary market for next 6 months: weddings + private celebrations (birthdays, engagements, etc.); no venues/festivals this quarter.<br>Trade-offs: broader TAM is delayed to get faster focus and product-fit learning.<br>Metrics: >=80% of new paid events must be weddings/private celebrations, <=20% of acquisition spend on non-eligible segments, and weekly in-scope leads/retention reviewed by segment.<br>Review date: 2026-05-14 | 2026-02-14 | MARKETING-PLAN.md, ACCOUNT-TYPES.md | Closed |
| P0-2 | Canonical live price is $2/guest; venue subscriptions ($39/$89/$179/mo) remain a future feature and are not live.<br>Trade-offs: faster execution and clearer sales messaging now; slower access to recurring-revenue runway until subscriptions launch.<br>Metrics: 100% of newly-created paid events must use $2/guest, no active checkout path exposes venue subscriptions, and all published pricing docs are consistent by end-of-day each Tuesday.<br>Review date: 2026-05-14 | 2026-02-14 | PRICING-MODELS.md, ACCOUNT-TYPES.md | Closed |
| P0-3 | Canonical Pro economics: retail stays $2/guest, pro event rate is $1.20/guest (40% discount), pro referral commission is $0.80/guest (40%), and no couple discount on referred events. <br>Trade-offs: higher pro margin clarity and partner incentive coherence vs potential friction for price-sensitive referrals. <br>Metrics: 100% of pro event pricing in active quotes/docs must use $1.20/guest, referral payout logic must award $0.80/guest, and any referred event must not receive couple discount. <br>Review date: 2026-05-14 | 2026-02-14 | PRO-ACCOUNT-DEEP-DIVE.md, PRICING-MODELS.md, ACCOUNT-TYPES.md | Closed |
| P0-4 | Primary growth loop: Pro network (photographers and planners refer paying clients). Secondary loop: guest email flywheel (guests become future re-activation and sharing channel).<br>Trade-offs: faster revenue feedback through B2B referrals vs higher concentration risk in partner onboarding and retention.<br>Metrics: at least 60% of paid event leads from the pro loop in week 1, guest-email-driven re-engagement >=10% open rate, and no quarter should run with both loops disabled as backup contributors. <br>Review date: 2026-05-14 | 2026-02-14 | MARKETING-PLAN.md | Closed |
| P0-5 | Message architecture is emotional and clear: "Don't let one missed moment be the one that breaks your night."<br>Core pillars: one, no-app guest participation via table QR; two, fear-of-missing-moment framing in first-touch copy; three, one shared destination for every event photo so no one is left out.<br>Trade-offs: stronger emotional framing reduces feature density in top-tier messaging, but increases recall and urgency. Not-saying-yet: no social-app/algorithmic-social positioning, no AI-watermark guarantees, no broad B2B platform promises as headline story.<br>Metrics: 100% of new campaign copy uses the emotional core language, and at least 2 message variants are A/B tested each week until top CTR variant is stable.<br>Review date: 2026-05-14 | 2026-02-14 | MARKETING-PLAN.md | Closed |
| P0-6 | Guest-capture compliance is set to baseline-only for now: transactional communications remain enabled (receipts, QR links, event confirmations), existing platform consent defaults stay in place, and no new region-specific privacy/legal model is committed yet.<br>Trade-offs: faster delivery and fewer implementation dependencies, with deeper legal/compliance policy intentionally deferred until next phase.<br>Metrics: no region-specific compliance changes are introduced this phase; compliance refresh must complete before expansion outside current baseline scope.<br>Review date: 2026-05-14 | 2026-02-14 |  | Closed |
| P1-7 | Active channel scorecard is set:<br>- Pro outreach (Hypothesis: direct warm partner outreach drives highest-intent paid events. KPI: qualified leads/week. Pass: >=8 leads/week and >=10% convert to draft events. Stop-loss: <5 leads/week for 2 weeks.)<br>- Organic social IG/TikTok/Reels/Shorts (Hypothesis: short-form drives low-cost direct demand. KPI: CTR-to-signup from tracked links. Pass: >=1.8% CTR + >=40 new trial clicks/week. Stop-loss: CTR <0.8% for 2 weeks.)<br>- Reddit & communities (Hypothesis: community-native reach drives trust and inquiry. KPI: tracked clicks and qualified responses/week. Pass: >=20 clicks/week and >=3 qualified responses/week. Stop-loss: <10 clicks/week for 2 weeks.)<br>- Guest email flywheel (Hypothesis: post-event follow-up increases re-activation/referrals. KPI: open + share-click rate/week. Pass: open >=18%, share-click >=4%. Stop-loss: open <10% or click <2% for 2 weeks.)<br>- Optional pilots: WeddingTok creators and Pro-to-Pro (Hypothesis: high-intent referral pockets. KPI: sourced events in 14 days. Pass: >=2 events. Stop-loss: none sourced in 14 days.)<br>Trade-offs: one-timewide focus improves learning speed but drops breadth of experimentation. Not a growth loop: Pro outreach + guest email remain primary/secondary priorities this quarter.<br>Review date: 2026-05-14 | 2026-02-14 | MARKETING-PLAN.md | Closed |
| P1-8 | Not needed yet for single-founder execution. Keep lightweight personal checks only (manual, as needed); formal weekly KPI cadence + scale/hold/kill protocol will be defined when a team is operational. | 2026-02-14 |  | Open |
| P1-9 | Lean founder launch playbook:<br>Week 1: finalize assets/messages, publish first channel batch, and harden onboarding flow for first 20 events.<br>Week 2: run first full campaign burst and fix top 3 friction points from support + conversion behavior.<br>Week 3: tighten one winning channel, pause one weakest channel, and reallocate time to the top performer.<br>Week 4: refresh creative + run one experimental campaign variant and publish a one-page launch learnings note.<br>Task execution order: messaging lock → campaign launch → onboarding monitor → weekly optimization → fallback decision.<br>Risk fallback: if paid-lead quality is below threshold for 14 days, pause that channel and move to lowest-cost alternate among remaining channels.<br>Trade-offs: low overhead and fast iteration, with less process ceremony than a full team launch office.<br>Review date: 2026-05-14 | 2026-02-14 | MARKETING-PLAN.md | Closed |
| P1-10 |  |  |  | Open |
| P1-11 |  |  |  | Open |
| P1-12 |  |  |  | Open |
| P2-13 |  |  |  | Open |

## Decision Dependency Map (Answer in This Order)

Some questions are prerequisites for others. Use this dependency flow to avoid rework:

1. **P0-1 Primary market focus**  
   ↓ informs
2. **P0-5 Message architecture** and **P0-4 growth loop choice**  
   ↓ informs
3. **P0-2 canonical pricing** + **P0-3 Pro economics**  
   ↓ informs
4. **P1-9 launch playbook** + **P1-7 channel tests** + **P1-10 referral design**  
   ↓ informs
5. **P1-8 KPI cadence** + **P1-11 retention strategy** + **P1-12 assumption register**  
   ↓ informs
6. **P2 expansion gates** (venue/festival/app/naming/economics by segment)

### Rule
If an upstream decision changes, downstream answers must be reviewed within 48 hours.

## Decision Quality Checklist (Use Before Marking “Closed”)

Before closing any question in the log, verify:

- [ ] **Decision statement:** answer is explicit (not ambiguous).
- [ ] **Trade-offs captured:** what was intentionally deprioritized is written.
- [ ] **Metrics attached:** success/failure signals are defined.
- [ ] **Docs synced:** all affected strategy docs are updated.
- [ ] **Date stamped:** decision has a timestamp for auditability.
- [ ] **Review date set:** when this decision will be revisited is defined.

If any checkbox is missing, keep status as **Open** or **In Progress**.

---

## Status Legend & Escalation Rules

Use consistent status labels in the Decision Log:

- **Open** — not discussed yet
- **In Progress** — discussion underway, no final decision
- **Blocked** — waiting on prerequisite decision or missing data
- **Closed** — decision approved, documented, and docs updated
- **Revisit** — previously closed decision requires reassessment

### Escalation rules
- Any **Priority 0** item still `Open` or `Blocked` after 7 days escalates to leadership review.
- Any `Closed` decision changed within 14 days requires a short “reason for change” note.
- Any `Blocked` item must list what unblock condition is required and who owns that unblock.
