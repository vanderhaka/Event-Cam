## Priority 0 — Must Answer Immediately (Path-Defining)

## 1) What is the single primary market for the next 6 months?
- **Why this matters:** Prevents split focus across weddings, venues, festivals, and app vision.
- **Decision options:**
  - A) Weddings only
  - B) Weddings + one secondary motion (Pro *or* Venue)
- **Clarity test:** Can you explain this in one sentence?

## 2) What is the canonical live pricing model right now?
- **Why this matters:** Current docs contain conflicting numbers.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Live price table
  - Explicit “not live” pricing assumptions
  - One source-of-truth for pricing assumptions

## 3) What is the final Pro economics model for this phase?
- **Why this matters:** Contradictory commission/margin framing harms partner trust.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Pro-created path economics
  - Referred path economics
  - Coupon/discount logic
  - Payout rules

## 4) What is the one dominant growth loop for this quarter?
- **Why this matters:** Running multiple loops in parallel slows learning.
- **Decision options:**
  - A) Pro partner loop
  - B) Guest flywheel loop
  - C) Content/organic loop
- **Rule:** Pick one primary loop, one secondary support loop max.

## 5) What message architecture is official for this quarter?
- **Why this matters:** Prevents “no app required” vs “social app” narrative conflict.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Core one-liner
  - 3 proof pillars
  - “Not saying yet” boundary list

## 6) What are the non-negotiable legal/compliance rules for guest capture?
- **Why this matters:** Flywheel performance depends on compliant consent and outreach.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Consent policy by region
  - Transactional vs marketing email policy
  - Data retention and deletion policy

## Priority 1 — Needed in the Next 2–4 Weeks

## 7) Which channels are we actively testing, and what is the kill criteria for each?
- **Why this matters:** Avoids channel sprawl.
- **Required outputs:** Scorecard for each active experiment (hypothesis, KPI, pass/fail threshold, stop-loss).

## 8) What is our weekly KPI operating cadence?
- **Why this matters:** Strategy without measurement drifts into opinion.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Weekly metric review person (you)
  - Weekly review meeting
  - Scale / hold / kill decision protocol

## 9) What is the launch playbook timeline and execution responsibility map?
- **Why this matters:** Phases are defined, but day-level operations need accountability.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Week-by-week launch plan
  - Task list with execution order
  - Risk fallback plan

## 10) What is the referral program design (exactly)?
- **Why this matters:** Repeatedly referenced as a growth lever but under-specified.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Incentive structure
  - Attribution window
  - Abuse prevention
  - Financial sustainability threshold

## 11) What is our retention strategy for recurring channels (Pro/Venue)?
- **Why this matters:** Recurring channels can scale fast or churn fast.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Health score definition
  - Churn risk triggers
  - Intervention playbooks

## 12) What assumptions are we treating as facts without evidence?
- **Why this matters:** High-confidence projections can hide fragile assumptions.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Assumption register
  - Confidence level per assumption
  - Validation plan and date

---

## Priority 2 — Needed Before Broader Expansion

## 13) What has to be true before venue expansion becomes a core motion?
- **Why this matters:** Venue path likely requires different onboarding, retention, and support model.
- **Required outputs:** Minimum qualification metrics and pilot outcomes.

## 14) What has to be true before festival/multi-day is considered active GTM?
- **Why this matters:** Enterprise-style expectations differ substantially from wedding workflows.
- **Required outputs:** Segment-specific validation criteria and ROI case.

## 15) What has to be true before social app build moves from vision to execution?
- **Why this matters:** App work is high effort and can dilute current GTM momentum.
- **Required outputs:** Metric gate thresholds (activation, retention, install intent).

## 16) What naming decision criteria are final?
- **Why this matters:** Naming affects brand rollouts, domain decisions, and messaging consistency.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Legal screen criteria
  - Customer preference criteria
  - Timeline for final selection

## 17) What is our channel-level unit economics baseline by segment?
- **Why this matters:** Spend decisions require comparable CAC/payback across channels.
- **Required outputs:** Standardized channel economics dashboard.

---

## Decision Ritual (Recommended)

For each question above, capture:

- **Decision:** chosen answer
- **Date decided:** timestamp
- **Implication:** what changes now
- **Docs to update:** which strategy docs must be synced

If any Priority 0 question is unanswered, treat it as an execution blocker for expansion initiatives.

## Decision Log (Fill as Answers Are Finalized)

| Question ID | Decision | Date Decided | Docs to Update | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0-1 | Primary market for next 6 months: weddings + private celebrations (birthdays, engagements, etc.); no venues/festivals this quarter.<br>Trade-offs: broader TAM is delayed to get faster focus and product-fit learning.<br>Metrics: >=80% of new paid events must be weddings/private celebrations, <=20% of acquisition spend on non-eligible segments, and weekly in-scope leads/retention reviewed by segment.<br>Review date: 2026-05-14 | 2026-02-14 | MARKETING-PLAN.md, ACCOUNT-TYPES.md | Closed |
| P0-2 | Canonical live price is $2/guest; venue subscriptions ($39/$89/$179/mo) remain a future feature and are not live.<br>Trade-offs: faster execution and clearer sales messaging now; slower access to recurring-revenue runway until subscriptions launch.<br>Metrics: 100% of newly-created paid events must use $2/guest, no active checkout path exposes venue subscriptions, and all published pricing docs are consistent by end-of-day each Tuesday.<br>Review date: 2026-05-14 | 2026-02-14 | PRICING-MODELS.md, ACCOUNT-TYPES.md | Closed |
| P0-3 | Canonical Pro economics (REVISED 2026-02-15): retail stays $2/guest, pro wholesale base rate is $1.20/guest (40% discount), pro referral credit is $0.40/guest (20%) as non-cashable credit toward future events, and no couple discount on referred events. **Credits-first model with optional payout at $100+ minimum via Stripe Connect Express (monthly).** Payout serves connector Pros (bands, dress shops, florists) who refer but never create events. Pro-to-Pro recruitment discount: +2%/+1%/+0.5% per active downstream Pro across 3 tiers, cap 55% ($0.90/guest floor). Credits never expire.<br>Trade-offs: eliminates payout infrastructure and tax reporting complexity; credits keep Pros locked into platform; lower referral rate (20% vs old 40%) but compensated by recruitment discount system.<br>Metrics: 100% of pro event pricing in active quotes/docs must use $1.20/guest base rate, referral credit logic must award $0.40/guest, recruitment discount recalculated monthly on trailing 12-month activity, payout option available at $100+ credit balance via Stripe Connect Express.<br>Review date: 2026-05-14 | 2026-02-15 | PRO-ACCOUNT-DEEP-DIVE.md, PRICING-MODELS.md, ACCOUNT-TYPES.md, MARKETING-PLAN.md | Closed |
| P0-4 | Primary growth loop: Pro network (photographers and planners refer paying clients). Secondary loop: guest email flywheel (guests become future re-activation and sharing channel).<br>Trade-offs: faster revenue feedback through B2B referrals vs higher concentration risk in partner onboarding and retention.<br>Metrics: at least 60% of paid event leads from the pro loop in week 1, guest-email-driven re-engagement >=10% open rate, and no quarter should run with both loops disabled as backup contributors. <br>Review date: 2026-05-14 | 2026-02-14 | MARKETING-PLAN.md | Closed |
| P0-5 | Message architecture is emotional and clear: "Don't let one missed moment be the one that breaks your night."<br>Core pillars: one, no-app guest participation via table QR; two, fear-of-missing-moment framing in first-touch copy; three, one shared destination for every event photo so no one is left out.<br>Trade-offs: stronger emotional framing reduces feature density in top-tier messaging, but increases recall and urgency. Not-saying-yet: no social-app/algorithmic-social positioning, no AI-watermark guarantees, no broad B2B platform promises as headline story.<br>Metrics: 100% of new campaign copy uses the emotional core language, and at least 2 message variants are A/B tested each week until top CTR variant is stable.<br>Review date: 2026-05-14 | 2026-02-14 | MARKETING-PLAN.md | Closed |
| P0-6 | Guest-capture compliance is set to baseline-only for now: transactional communications remain enabled (receipts, QR links, event confirmations), existing platform consent defaults stay in place, and no new region-specific privacy/legal model is committed yet.<br>Trade-offs: faster delivery and fewer implementation dependencies, with deeper legal/compliance policy intentionally deferred until next phase.<br>Metrics: no region-specific compliance changes are introduced this phase; compliance refresh must complete before expansion outside current baseline scope.<br>Review date: 2026-05-14 | 2026-02-14 |  | Closed |
| P1-7 | Active channel scorecard is set:<br>- Pro outreach (Hypothesis: direct warm partner outreach drives highest-intent paid events. KPI: qualified leads/week. Pass: >=8 leads/week and >=10% convert to draft events. Stop-loss: <5 leads/week for 2 weeks.)<br>- Organic social IG/TikTok/Reels/Shorts (Hypothesis: short-form drives low-cost direct demand. KPI: CTR-to-signup from tracked links. Pass: >=1.8% CTR + >=40 new trial clicks/week. Stop-loss: CTR <0.8% for 2 weeks.)<br>- Reddit & communities (Hypothesis: community-native reach drives trust and inquiry. KPI: tracked clicks and qualified responses/week. Pass: >=20 clicks/week and >=3 qualified responses/week. Stop-loss: <10 clicks/week for 2 weeks.)<br>- Guest email flywheel (Hypothesis: post-event follow-up increases re-activation/referrals. KPI: open + share-click rate/week. Pass: open >=18%, share-click >=4%. Stop-loss: open <10% or click <2% for 2 weeks.)<br>- Optional pilots: WeddingTok creators and Pro-to-Pro (Hypothesis: high-intent referral pockets. KPI: sourced events in 14 days. Pass: >=2 events. Stop-loss: none sourced in 14 days.)<br>Trade-offs: one-timewide focus improves learning speed but drops breadth of experimentation. Not a growth loop: Pro outreach + guest email remain primary/secondary priorities this quarter.<br>Review date: 2026-05-14 | 2026-02-14 | MARKETING-PLAN.md | Closed |
| P1-8 | Not needed yet for single-founder execution (10-20 hrs/week side project). Keep lightweight personal checks only (manual, as needed); formal weekly KPI cadence + scale/hold/kill protocol will be defined when a team is operational.<br>**Minimum tracking (no formal cadence):** Weekly glance at: events created, photos uploaded, guest participation rate, support requests. No dashboards, no meetings, no process ceremony until there are paying customers.<br>Trade-offs: no formal measurement discipline risks missing signals, but process overhead on a side project with zero revenue is worse.<br>Metrics: revisit when monthly events exceed 20 or monthly revenue exceeds $2,000.<br>Review date: 2026-08-15 | 2026-02-15 |  | Closed |
| P1-9 | Lean founder launch playbook:<br>Week 1: finalize assets/messages, publish first channel batch, and harden onboarding flow for first 20 events.<br>Week 2: run first full campaign burst and fix top 3 friction points from support + conversion behavior.<br>Week 3: tighten one winning channel, pause one weakest channel, and reallocate time to the top performer.<br>Week 4: refresh creative + run one experimental campaign variant and publish a one-page launch learnings note.<br>Task execution order: messaging lock → campaign launch → onboarding monitor → weekly optimization → fallback decision.<br>Risk fallback: if paid-lead quality is below threshold for 14 days, pause that channel and move to lowest-cost alternate among remaining channels.<br>Trade-offs: low overhead and fast iteration, with less process ceremony than a full team launch office.<br>Review date: 2026-05-14 | 2026-02-14 | MARKETING-PLAN.md | Closed |
| P1-10 | Pro-to-Pro referral program design:<br>**Incentive structure:** 3-tier recruitment discount on wholesale rate. Tier 1 (direct recruit): +2% per active Pro. Tier 2 (recruit's recruit): +1%. Tier 3 (3rd degree): +0.5%. Cap: 55% total ($0.90/guest floor). Path 2 referral credits: 20% ($0.40/guest), non-cashable, never expire, applied to future Path 1 events. No cash payouts.<br>**Attribution window:** 90-day cookie for client referral links. Pro-to-Pro recruitment is permanent (first recruiter wins, each Pro has one upline).<br>**Abuse prevention:** "Active" requires 1 paid event in trailing 12 months (fake accounts cost real money). Each Pro has one upline only — no circular chains. Self-referral blocked by requiring different payment method/email on referred events.<br>**Payout option:** Credits above $100 can be cashed out via Stripe Connect Express (monthly). Serves connector Pros (bands, dress shops, florists) who refer couples but never create their own events. Same unified credit system — active Pros spend credits on events, connector Pros cash out.<br>**Financial sustainability:** At 55% cap, Event-Cam keeps $0.90/guest (healthy). Each recruited Pro generates ~$432/month revenue at 3 events × 120 guests × $1.20. Cost of recruiter's discount: ~$108/month. Net: +$324/month per recruit. Credits are deferred liability with breakage (some never redeemed).<br>**Eliminated:** Couple-to-couple referrals and guest-to-couple referrals — removed from all docs.<br>Trade-offs: MLM-style structure adds complexity but scales Pro network without founder outreach. Credits-first with optional payout balances simplicity with connector Pro inclusion. 20% credit is conservative — can increase later.<br>Review date: 2026-05-14 | 2026-02-15 | PRO-ACCOUNT-DEEP-DIVE.md, PRICING-MODELS.md, ACCOUNT-TYPES.md, MARKETING-PLAN.md | Closed |
| P1-11 | Retention strategy — lightweight, solo-founder appropriate:<br>**Active window:** 12 months (1 paid event per year keeps Pro active). Eliminates seasonal churn entirely — no grace periods needed.<br>**Health score (simple):** Green = event in last 6 months or login in last 30 days. Yellow = no event in 6-12 months. Red = approaching 12-month lapse.<br>**Automated interventions (P0):** 9-month / 10.5-month / 11.5-month lapse warning emails with specific dollar impact. Post-event follow-up email at 48hrs to fill pipeline.<br>**Dashboard:** Credit balance front and center, activity countdown bar, downstream Pro status for recruiters.<br>**Connector Pro retention:** Auto-ship physical referral materials (cards, signs) annually. Auto-text at $100 cash-out threshold. Minimize friction — these Pros drift away from small friction, not active decisions.<br>**Recruitment chain transparency:** Dashboard shows which downstream Pros are active/at risk and dollar impact if they lapse. Notify upstream Pro at 9 months so they can personally nudge their recruit.<br>Trade-offs: 12-month window is very generous (a Pro doing 1 event/year stays active), but eliminates false churn from seasonality and keeps the system simple. Formal cadence/team processes deferred until team exists.<br>Review date: 2026-05-14 | 2026-02-15 | PRO-ACCOUNT-DEEP-DIVE.md | Closed |
| P1-12 | Full assumption register created with 48 assumptions across 10 categories (Unit Economics, Guest Behavior, Flywheel, Pro Network, Revenue, Channels, Operations, Legal, Competitive, Social App). See ASSUMPTION-REGISTER.md for complete register.<br>**Top 5 critical findings:**<br>1. No cost-to-serve analysis exists — the $0.90/guest Pro floor may be unprofitable (FIN-1, UNKNOWN confidence)<br>2. CSAM detection and BIPA compliance are unaddressed legal obligations (LEGAL-1, LEGAL-2, UNKNOWN confidence)<br>3. Guest upload rate (40-50% target), email capture (80% target), and flywheel conversion (2% target) are all LOW confidence with no empirical basis<br>4. The Pro adoption thesis (primary growth loop) has zero professional interviews to support it<br>5. Revenue projections (30→500 weddings/month in 12 months) are LOW confidence for a solo-founder cold start<br>**5 systemic patterns:** (a) revenue projections built on unvalidated unit economics, (b) specific numbers appear without empirical basis, (c) flywheel is a long-term asset not near-term engine, (d) Pro adoption thesis is untested, (e) legal/compliance gaps in CSAM, BIPA, GDPR, MLM classification<br>**Validation roadmap:** 4 items to validate immediately (cost model, CSAM, BIPA, Stripe fees), 10 before launch, 5 in first 60 days, 5 in first 6 months, 3 in 6-12 months.<br>Trade-offs: comprehensive register adds planning overhead but prevents building on unvalidated foundations. Some assumptions (flywheel conversion) require 6-12 months to validate — must proceed with caution, not paralysis.<br>Review date: 2026-05-14 | 2026-02-15 | ASSUMPTION-REGISTER.md (new), MARKETING-PLAN.md (add assumption confidence tags), PRO-ACCOUNT-DEEP-DIVE.md (add cost model) | Closed |
| P2-13 | Venue expansion is fully deferred until wedding MRR sustains at $20-25K for 2 consecutive months. No discovery calls, no engineering, no marketing spend on venues until the MRR gate clears. Once gate clears: (1) begin structured venue discovery calls (15+ across 3+ sub-segments), (2) define single venue ICP based on findings, (3) validate pricing at $99/$199/$399/mo (events/month tiers), (4) run 5-10 venue pilot with soft kill guidelines, (5) hire or allocate someone to own venue ops before scaling. Venues become a core motion only after successful pilot + dedicated hire. **Canonical venue pricing (provisional, pending discovery validation): Starter $99/mo (up to 4 events), Growth $199/mo (up to 12 events), Unlimited $399/mo (unlimited events).** Event Cam retains all guest data — venues do not get guest email lists. Brand dilution is a minor tracked concern; no public venue marketing until brand architecture decision is made.<br>Trade-offs: delays recurring revenue from venues by 12+ months, but protects wedding focus during critical early growth phase. Competitor risk accepted — a distracted solo founder is a bigger existential threat. Higher pricing ($99/$199/$399 vs earlier $39/$89/$179) positions as premium and improves unit economics but narrows addressable market to serious venues.<br>Metrics: wedding MRR is the primary trigger — no venue activity below $20K MRR. Once discovery begins: ≥60% of interviewed venues willing to pay ≥$99/mo. Pilot benchmarks (soft): ≥70% venue retention at 12 weeks, ≥15% guest upload rate per event, founder time ≤2 hrs/week per 5 venues post-onboarding, wedding MRR growth decline ≤25% during pilot.<br>Review date: 2027-01-15 (Q1 2027 — revisit gate progress; if wedding MRR below $15K at review, defer venue planning to Q3 2027) | 2026-02-15 | PRICING-MODELS.md, ACCOUNT-TYPES.md | Closed |
| P2-14 | Festival/multi-day is fully deferred — not a priority and no external demand signal exists. No investigation, no feature scoping, no marketing until ALL of: (1) wedding product has achieved PMF (50+ paid events/month sustained for 2 months), (2) at least 3 unprompted inbound requests from festival/multi-day organizers, (3) founder has bandwidth (team hire or full-time commitment). Festival/multi-day likely requires: multi-day event flows, enterprise pricing, different onboarding, on-site support expectations, and potentially hardware (kiosks). None of this is worth scoping until wedding is proven.<br>Trade-offs: may miss early festival opportunities, but a side-project founder building for enterprise-style clients is a recipe for failure. Weddings first.<br>Metrics: PMF gate (50+ paid events/month) + 3 inbound requests + bandwidth. All three required.<br>Review date: 2027-06-15 (18 months out — only revisit if gates are met sooner) | 2026-02-15 |  | Closed |
| P2-15 | Social app remains as a North Star vision document but NO execution until gates are met. SOCIAL-APP-EXPLORATION.md stays as-is for long-term direction. Gates before any social app work begins: (1) 100+ paid events/month sustained for 3 months, (2) browser album revisit rate measured — at least 20% of guests revisit album within 30 days (proves desire to re-engage with event content), (3) lightweight social test (add reactions/comments to browser album) shows 10%+ guest engagement, (4) founder is full-time or has a team. **Incremental validation path:** Once the browser album exists, add a simple "heart" reaction button and a comment field. Measure engagement. This costs near-zero development effort and provides the signal needed to justify (or kill) the app vision.<br>Trade-offs: delays the long-term defensibility story, but building an app for a product that has zero users is premature optimization. The web-first approach is correct.<br>Metrics: album revisit rate ≥20%, social feature engagement ≥10%, 100+ events/month, full-time commitment. All four required.<br>Review date: 2027-01-15 | 2026-02-15 | SOCIAL-APP-EXPLORATION.md (add gates to top of doc) | Closed |
| P2-16 | Rebrand is desired. Shortlist exists from NAMING-BRAINSTORM.md. Decision criteria and process:<br>**Legal screen:** (1) Domain available (.com or .co at minimum), (2) No existing trademark in AU/US/UK in Class 9 (software) or Class 42 (SaaS), (3) Social handles available on Instagram + TikTok (primary channels). Fail any = eliminate candidate.<br>**Customer preference:** (1) Run a paid ad test ($50-$100) with 2-3 name candidates as headlines — measure CTR, (2) Ask 10 engaged couples: "Which name would you click on for a wedding guest photo tool?", (3) "Brunch test" — say it out loud in a sentence. Does it sound like a product or a feeling?<br>**Timeline:** Keep "Event Cam" through MVP testing (Phase A-B in the revised action plan). Rebrand before any public marketing or paid acquisition. Target: naming decision finalized by the time MVP is proven with 5+ real events. No rush — zero brand equity exists to lose.<br>**Naming criteria (weighted):** Clarity of function (30%) — does someone hearing the name for the first time understand it's about event photos? Memorability (25%) — can someone recall it 48 hours later? Domain/social availability (20%) — must be available. Emotional resonance (15%) — does it evoke the "morning after magic" feeling? Verb potential (10%) — nice-to-have, not required.<br>Trade-offs: rebranding before any traction means zero switching cost. Waiting too long means building SEO/brand equity under a name you'll abandon. The sweet spot is: rename after MVP validation, before public marketing.<br>Review date: 2026-06-15 | 2026-02-15 | NAMING-BRAINSTORM.md | Closed |
| P2-17 | Deferred entirely until first paid channel spend. Cannot measure channel-level unit economics with zero marketing spend and zero paying customers. **When to activate:** Once any paid channel (Google Ads, Meta, influencer, etc.) has $500+ cumulative spend, build a simple tracking sheet: channel, spend, leads, conversions, revenue, CAC, payback period. No dashboard needed — a spreadsheet row per channel per month is sufficient at this scale.<br>**Measurement framework (ready to deploy when spend begins):** For each active paid channel, track: (1) spend/month, (2) impressions, (3) clicks, (4) signups, (5) paid events, (6) revenue from those events, (7) CAC = spend / paid events, (8) payback = CAC / avg revenue per event. Compare channels on CAC and payback monthly. Scale winners, kill losers per P1-7 scorecard.<br>For organic channels (social, communities, Pro outreach), track time invested (hours/week) as the "spend" equivalent. Calculate CAC as (hours x implied hourly rate) / paid events.<br>Trade-offs: no measurement framework means early spend is untracked, but building dashboards before spending is premature optimization.<br>Metrics: activate this item when cumulative paid channel spend exceeds $500.<br>Review date: 2026-08-15 | 2026-02-15 |  | Closed |

## Decision Dependency Map (Answer in This Order)

Some questions are prerequisites for others. Use this dependency flow to avoid rework:

1. **P0-1 Primary market focus**  
   ↓ informs
2. **P0-5 Message architecture** and **P0-4 growth loop choice**  
   ↓ informs
3. **P0-2 canonical pricing** + **P0-3 Pro economics**  
   ↓ informs
4. **P1-9 launch playbook** + **P1-7 channel tests** + **P1-10 referral design**  
   ↓ informs
5. **P1-8 KPI cadence** + **P1-11 retention strategy** + **P1-12 assumption register**  
   ↓ informs
6. **P2 expansion gates** (venue/festival/app/naming/economics by segment)

### Rule
If an upstream decision changes, downstream answers must be reviewed within 48 hours.

## Decision Quality Checklist (Use Before Marking “Closed”)

Before closing any question in the log, verify:

- [ ] **Decision statement:** answer is explicit (not ambiguous).
- [ ] **Trade-offs captured:** what was intentionally deprioritized is written.
- [ ] **Metrics attached:** success/failure signals are defined.
- [ ] **Docs synced:** all affected strategy docs are updated.
- [ ] **Date stamped:** decision has a timestamp for auditability.
- [ ] **Review date set:** when this decision will be revisited is defined.

If any checkbox is missing, keep status as **Open** or **In Progress**.

---

## Status Legend & Escalation Rules

Use consistent status labels in the Decision Log:

- **Open** — not discussed yet
- **In Progress** — discussion underway, no final decision
- **Blocked** — waiting on prerequisite decision or missing data
- **Closed** — decision approved, documented, and docs updated
- **Revisit** — previously closed decision requires reassessment

### Escalation rules
- Any **Priority 0** item still `Open` or `Blocked` after 7 days escalates to leadership review.
- Any `Closed` decision changed within 14 days requires a short “reason for change” note.
- Any `Blocked` item must list what unblock condition is required and who owns that unblock.

## Top 10 Decisive Questions (If You Need Fast Decision Clarity)

If time is constrained, answer these first:

1. What is the single primary market for the next 6 months? (P0-1)
2. What is the canonical live pricing table? (P0-2)
3. What are final Pro economics for this phase? (P0-3)
4. What is the one dominant growth loop this quarter? (P0-4)
5. What is the official message architecture for this quarter? (P0-5)
6. What are non-negotiable compliance rules for guest capture? (P0-6)
7. Which 3–5 channels are actively being tested now? (P1-7)
8. What is the weekly KPI cadence and execution responsibility map? (P1-8)
9. What is the launch timeline with explicit ownership? (P1-9)
10. What is the exact referral program design and abuse policy? (P1-10)

If these ten are answered clearly, most downstream decisions become significantly easier.
