# Questions That Need Answers

> Purpose: force alignment on core decisions so strategy execution stays focused.
>
> How to use:
> 1. Answer **Priority 0** questions first.
> 2. For each answer, record owner + decision date.
> 3. Any unanswered Priority 0 item blocks expansion work.

## Priority 0 — Must Answer Immediately (Path-Defining)

## 1) What is the single primary market for the next 6 months?
- **Why this matters:** Prevents split focus across weddings, venues, festivals, and app vision.
- **Decision options:**
  - A) Weddings only
  - B) Weddings + one secondary motion (Pro *or* Venue)
- **Alignment test:** Could every team member explain this in one sentence?

## 2) What is the canonical live pricing model right now?
- **Why this matters:** Current docs contain conflicting numbers.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Live price table
  - Explicit “not live” pricing assumptions
  - One source-of-truth owner

## 3) What is the final Pro economics model for this phase?
- **Why this matters:** Contradictory commission/margin framing harms partner trust.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Pro-created path economics
  - Referred path economics
  - Coupon/discount logic
  - Payout rules

## 4) What is the one dominant growth loop for this quarter?
- **Why this matters:** Running multiple loops in parallel slows learning.
- **Decision options:**
  - A) Pro partner loop
  - B) Guest flywheel loop
  - C) Content/organic loop
- **Rule:** Pick one primary loop, one secondary support loop max.

## 5) What message architecture is official for this quarter?
- **Why this matters:** Prevents “no app required” vs “social app” narrative conflict.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Core one-liner
  - 3 proof pillars
  - “Not saying yet” boundary list

## 6) What are the non-negotiable legal/compliance rules for guest capture?
- **Why this matters:** Flywheel performance depends on compliant consent and outreach.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Consent policy by region
  - Transactional vs marketing email policy
  - Data retention and deletion policy

## Priority 1 — Needed in the Next 2–4 Weeks

## 7) Which channels are we actively testing, and what is the kill criteria for each?
- **Why this matters:** Avoids channel sprawl.
- **Required outputs:** Scorecard for each active experiment (hypothesis, KPI, pass/fail threshold, stop-loss).

## 8) What is our weekly KPI operating cadence?
- **Why this matters:** Strategy without measurement drifts into opinion.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Weekly metric owner
  - Weekly review meeting
  - Scale / hold / kill decision protocol

## 9) What is the launch playbook timeline and owner map?
- **Why this matters:** Phases are defined, but day-level operations need accountability.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Week-by-week launch plan
  - Responsible owner per task
  - Risk fallback plan

## 10) What is the referral program design (exactly)?
- **Why this matters:** Repeatedly referenced as a growth lever but under-specified.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Incentive structure
  - Attribution window
  - Abuse prevention
  - Financial sustainability threshold

## 11) What is our retention strategy for recurring channels (Pro/Venue)?
- **Why this matters:** Recurring channels can scale fast or churn fast.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Health score definition
  - Churn risk triggers
  - Intervention playbooks

## 12) What assumptions are we treating as facts without evidence?
- **Why this matters:** High-confidence projections can hide fragile assumptions.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Assumption register
  - Confidence level per assumption
  - Validation plan and date

## Priority 2 — Needed Before Broader Expansion

## 13) What has to be true before venue expansion becomes a core motion?
- **Why this matters:** Venue path likely requires different onboarding, retention, and support model.
- **Required outputs:** Minimum qualification metrics and pilot outcomes.

## 14) What has to be true before festival/multi-day is considered active GTM?
- **Why this matters:** Enterprise-style expectations differ substantially from wedding workflows.
- **Required outputs:** Segment-specific validation criteria and ROI case.

## 15) What has to be true before social app build moves from vision to execution?
- **Why this matters:** App work is high effort and can dilute current GTM momentum.
- **Required outputs:** Metric gate thresholds (activation, retention, install intent).

## 16) What naming decision criteria are final?
- **Why this matters:** Naming affects brand rollouts, domain decisions, and messaging consistency.
- **Required outputs:**
  - Legal screen criteria
  - Customer preference criteria
  - Timeline for final selection

## 17) What is our channel-level unit economics baseline by segment?
- **Why this matters:** Spend decisions require comparable CAC/payback across channels.
- **Required outputs:** Standardized channel economics dashboard.

## Alignment Ritual (Recommended)

For each question above, capture:

- **Decision:** chosen answer
- **Owner:** accountable person
- **Date decided:** timestamp
- **Implication:** what changes now
- **Docs to update:** which strategy docs must be synced

If any Priority 0 question is unanswered, treat it as an execution blocker for expansion initiatives.

## Decision Dependency Map (Answer in This Order)

Some questions are prerequisites for others. Use this dependency flow to avoid rework:

1. **P0-1 Primary market focus**  
   ↓ informs
2. **P0-5 Message architecture** and **P0-4 growth loop choice**  
   ↓ informs
3. **P0-2 canonical pricing** + **P0-3 Pro economics**  
   ↓ informs
4. **P1-9 launch playbook** + **P1-7 channel tests** + **P1-10 referral design**  
   ↓ informs
5. **P1-8 KPI cadence** + **P1-11 retention strategy** + **P1-12 assumption register**  
   ↓ informs
6. **P2 expansion gates** (venue/festival/app/naming/economics by segment)

### Rule
If an upstream decision changes, downstream answers must be reviewed within 48 hours.

## Decision Quality Checklist (Use Before Marking “Closed”)

Before closing any question in the log, verify:

- [ ] **Clear owner:** one accountable person is assigned.
- [ ] **Decision statement:** answer is explicit (not ambiguous).
- [ ] **Trade-offs captured:** what was intentionally deprioritized is written.
- [ ] **Metrics attached:** success/failure signals are defined.
- [ ] **Docs synced:** all affected strategy docs are updated.
- [ ] **Date stamped:** decision has a timestamp for auditability.
- [ ] **Review date set:** when this decision will be revisited is defined.

If any checkbox is missing, keep status as **Open** or **In Progress**.
