## 1. Executive Summary

Every wedding ends the same way: hundreds of incredible photos trapped on guests' phones, scattered across group chats, or lost entirely. The couple — who spent months planning every detail — ends up with a fraction of the memories from their big day. Existing solutions require guests to download an app or create an account, and participation craters.

Event Cam eliminates that friction entirely. The couple creates their wedding event, adds their guest list, and distributes unique QR codes (table tents, place cards, signage). Guests scan with their phone camera, upload photos and videos in their browser, and they're done — no app, no account, no hassle.

What makes Event Cam special beyond the QR workflow:

- **AI-generated custom watermarks** — The couple provides their names, date, or a monogram, and AI generates a beautiful, one-of-a-kind watermark that's applied to every photo in the album. It's branded to their wedding, not a generic stamp.
- **Photo filters** — Guests (or the couple) can apply curated wedding-friendly filters before or after upload, giving the entire album a cohesive, polished aesthetic without hiring an editor.
- **Full moderation** — Every upload is reviewed before it hits the album. Approve or reject with one tap.
- **Private sharing** — Password-protected album links with optional view limits and expiration.

At **$1 per guest**, a 150-person wedding costs $150 — a rounding error in a wedding budget, but it delivers something no photographer alone can: every angle, every moment, from every guest.

**Core marketing thesis:** Position Event Cam as the modern replacement for disposable cameras and wedding photo apps. Lead with the emotional hook ("every memory from every guest") and differentiate on AI watermarks, filters, and the zero-friction guest experience.

## 2. Target Audience

### Primary Segment: Weddings

| Sub-Segment | Description | Guest Count | Revenue @ $1/guest | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Engaged couples (DIY)** | Couples planning their own wedding | 50–200 | $50–$200 | Largest volume; price-sensitive but $1/head is trivial |
| **Wedding planners** | Professional planners managing multiple weddings/year | 100–300 | $100–$300 per event | Repeat buyers; recommend tools to every client |
| **Destination weddings** | Smaller guest list, but high-value experience | 20–80 | $20–$80 | Especially value "no app download" since guests may have limited connectivity |
| **Large/cultural weddings** | Indian, Nigerian, Filipino, etc. — often 300–500+ guests | 300–500+ | $300–$500+ | Highest per-event revenue; strong community word-of-mouth |

### Secondary Segments (Future Expansion)

| Segment | Description | Opportunity |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Wedding photographers** | Use Event Cam as a guest-photo supplement alongside their professional shots | Power users who bring repeat business; natural referral channel |
| **Engagement parties & showers** | Pre-wedding events that serve as a trial run | Funnel into the wedding itself — if they use Event Cam for the shower, they'll use it for the wedding |
| **Anniversaries & vow renewals** | Milestone celebrations with similar dynamics to weddings | Same product, same price, organic expansion |
| **Corporate events** | Holiday parties, retreats, conferences | Future segment once wedding brand is established |

### Buyer Persona: "Soon-to-Be Sarah"

- 26–35 years old, recently engaged, 8–14 months out from the wedding
- Deep in wedding planning mode — reading The Knot, scrolling WeddingTok, pinning on Pinterest
- Already overwhelmed by decisions; wants tools that are simple and "just work"
- Hates the idea of asking 150 guests to download yet another app
- Loves the idea of a custom watermark with their names and date on every photo
- Budget-conscious but understands $1/guest ($150 total) is nothing compared to the photographer ($3,000+), the venue ($10,000+), or even the cake ($500+)
- Will absolutely share the product with her engaged friends if it works well

### Buyer Persona: "Planner Priya"

- 30–50 years old, professional wedding planner managing 15–40 weddings/year
- Always looking for tools that make her look good to clients
- Values reliability and polish — she's recommending this to paying clients
- Sees AI watermarks and filters as a "wow" feature she can showcase in proposals
- $1/guest is easy to pass through to the client or absorb as a business expense
- If she likes Event Cam, she brings 15–40 events/year of recurring revenue

## 3. Value Proposition & Messaging

### One-Liner

> **Every guest. Every photo. Your watermark. No app required.**

### Elevator Pitch

Event Cam is the easiest way to collect photos and videos from every guest at your wedding. Put QR codes on tables, guests scan with their phone and upload — no app, no account, no friction. AI generates a custom watermark with your names and wedding date that's applied to every photo. Add beautiful filters for a cohesive look. Moderate everything, build curated albums, and share with password-protected links. All for just $1 per guest.

### Messaging Pillars

| Pillar | Message | Proof Point |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Zero friction** | "Scan. Upload. Done." — Your guests never download an app or create an account | Browser-based upload; works on any phone with a camera |
| **AI watermarks** | "Your names. Your date. On every photo." — AI generates a custom, beautiful watermark unique to your wedding | One-of-a-kind AI-generated design, not a generic text stamp |
| **Filters & polish** | "A cohesive album without an editor." — Curated filters give every guest's photos a unified, polished look | Wedding-friendly filter presets applied in-browser or post-upload |
| **Full control** | "Your wedding, your album." — Review every photo before anyone sees it | Built-in approve/reject moderation queue |
| **Privacy-first** | "Private by default." — No public galleries, no social media leaks | Password-protected links with view limits and expiration |
| **Absurdly affordable** | "Less than a dollar per memory." — $1/guest makes it cheaper than a single disposable camera | 150 guests = $150; compare to $30+ per disposable camera table |

### Tagline Options

- "Every guest. Every photo. Your watermark."
- "The wedding album that fills itself."
- "Scan. Upload. Done. — $1 per guest."
- "No app. No friction. Every memory."
- "AI-watermarked. Guest-powered. Beautifully yours."

### Emotional Hook (for Ads & Landing Pages)

> Your photographer captures 500 perfect shots. Your 150 guests capture 2,000 more — the candid laughs, the dance floor chaos, the moments between moments. Event Cam collects them all, watermarks them with your names, and puts them in one beautiful album. For a dollar a guest.

## 4. Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses | Event Cam Advantage |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| **The Guest** (app) | Polished UI, established brand | Requires app download; $100+/event pricing; no AI features | No download + AI watermarks + filters + cheaper ($1/guest) |
| **WedUploader** | Wedding-focused | Limited features; dated UI | AI watermarks, filters, modern UX, simpler pricing |
| **Disposable cameras** | Nostalgia, tactile experience | $15–$30 each × 10–20 tables = $150–$600; low quality; development delay | Instant digital, higher quality, cheaper at scale, plus AI watermarks |
| **Google Photos shared album** | Free, familiar | Requires Google account; no moderation; no watermarks; no privacy controls; messy at 100+ contributors | Moderation + watermarks + filters + password-protected sharing |
| **Wedding hashtag (Instagram)** | Zero setup | Public; no control; buried in feed; no curation; guests forget to use it | Private, curated, QR-driven (no one forgets to scan a table card) |
| **WhatsApp/iMessage group** | Everyone has it | Compressed images; chaotic; no curation; no watermarks; maxes out fast | Full-resolution uploads, organized albums, AI watermarks |
| **Motif / Chatbooks** | Print-focused albums | Require manual upload; no guest collection workflow | Collect first, print later (future upsell) |

**Positioning:** Event Cam is the modern disposable camera — but digital, instant, AI-watermarked, and a fraction of the price. No other solution combines zero-friction QR collection, AI-generated watermarks, photo filters, moderation, and private sharing in one product for $1/guest.

### Differentiation Matrix

| Feature | Event Cam | The Guest | Disposable Cameras | Google Photos | Instagram Hashtag |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| No app download | Yes | No | N/A | No (need account) | No (need account) |
| AI custom watermarks | Yes | No | No | No | No |
| Photo filters | Yes | Limited | No | No | Yes (but public) |
| Moderation | Yes | Yes | N/A | No | No |
| Private sharing | Yes | Yes | N/A | Partial | No |
| Per-guest pricing | $1/guest | $100+ flat | $15–30/table | Free | Free |
| Cost for 150 guests | $150 | $100–200 | $300–600 | $0 | $0 |

## 5. Pricing Strategy

### Core Model: $1 Per Guest

| Example Wedding | Guests | Total Price | Context |
|----------------|--------|-------------|---------|
| Intimate / destination | 30 | $30 | Less than a single centerpiece |
| Mid-size | 100 | $100 | Less than the cake topper |
| Large | 200 | $200 | Less than the DJ's overtime fee |
| Grand / cultural | 400 | $400 | Still less than one hour of photography |

### Why $1/Guest Works

- **Dead simple** — No tiers to compare, no feature matrix to decode. "How many guests? That's how many dollars."
- **Scales naturally** — Larger weddings pay more, which is fair because they generate more media, use more storage, and get more value.
- **Trivially affordable** — The average US wedding costs $35,000. Even a 300-guest wedding at $300 is 0.85% of the budget. It's a line item that no couple will agonize over.
- **Easy for planners to quote** — "It's a dollar per guest" is something a planner can say in a consultation without pulling up a pricing page.
- **Aligns with current Stripe checkout** — Already built to charge per invite count.

### Minimum & Maximum

- **Minimum charge:** $20 (so sub-20-guest events still cover costs)
- **No maximum:** Let it scale. A 500-person wedding at $500 is still a bargain for the couple.

### Free Trial

- Allow one event with up to **10 guests** for free
- Full feature set including AI watermarks and filters — no feature gating
- Purpose: let engaged couples try it at a bridal shower or engagement party, then convert for the wedding
- This also lets wedding planners test before recommending to clients

### What's Included at $1/Guest (Everything)

- Unlimited photo and video uploads from guests
- AI-generated custom watermark (names, date, monogram — couple's choice)
- Full filter library for guests and couple
- Moderation dashboard (approve/reject)
- Curated albums with password-protected sharing
- QR code generation for all guests
- 12-month album hosting (media stays live for a year after the event)

### Future Premium Add-Ons (Upsell Opportunities)

| Add-On | Price Idea | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Extended hosting** | $2/month after 12 months | Keep albums live beyond the included year |
| **Photobook ordering** | $40–$80 | Partner with print-on-demand; one-click from the album |
| **AI slideshow / highlight reel** | $15–$25 | Auto-generate a video montage from the best uploads |
| **Custom filter creation** | $10 | Couple designs their own filter (color grade, grain, etc.) |
| **Rush watermark design** | $5 | AI generates 5+ watermark options with premium styles |
| **RAW/full-resolution export** | $10 | Download all originals in a ZIP |
| **White-label for planners** | $50/month | Remove Event Cam branding; planner's logo instead |

### Revenue Projections (Conservative)

| Metric | Phase 1 (Mo 1–3) | Phase 2 (Mo 3–6) | Phase 3 (Mo 6–12) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Weddings / month | 30 | 150 | 500 |
| Avg guests / wedding | 120 | 130 | 140 |
| Revenue / month | $3,600 | $19,500 | $70,000 |
| Upsell revenue (est. 10%) | $360 | $1,950 | $7,000 |
| **Total / month** | **$3,960** | **$21,450** | **$77,000** |

#### WeddingTok & Bridal Content Creators
- The wedding planning niche on TikTok is enormous. Partner with creators who post wedding tips, DIY wedding content, and budget breakdowns.

Even at the high end of the budget ($15,100), marketing spend is 58% of revenue — aggressive but typical for a growth-stage consumer product. As organic channels compound and referrals kick in, paid spend as a % of revenue should drop to 30–40% by month 8.

## 12. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Low guest participation** (guests don't scan QR) | High — product value depends on uploads | Medium | Provide couples with QR placement guides, printable table tent templates, and DJ announcement scripts; make QR impossible to miss; follow-up email to guests post-ceremony |
| **AI watermark quality** | High — if watermarks look generic or bad, it undermines the premium feel | Medium | Offer multiple AI-generated options per couple; allow manual adjustment; iterate on prompts and models based on satisfaction scores |
| **Wedding seasonality** | Medium — revenue heavily concentrated in May–October | High | Target destination/winter weddings in off-season; expand into engagement parties, bridal showers, anniversaries; launch corporate event push in Q4 |
| **Privacy concerns** | High — collecting photos involves consent | Medium | Mandatory consent screen before upload (already built); clear privacy policy; GDPR compliance for international weddings |
| **Competitor copies AI watermark feature** | Medium — AI features are easy to replicate | Medium | Build brand loyalty fast; invest in watermark quality and variety; layer on additional AI features (slideshow, auto-curation); build planner/photographer network effects |
| **$1/guest feels "too cheap"** | Low — some couples may question quality at a low price | Low | Frame as premium but accessible; show watermark/filter quality upfront; "premium features, transparent pricing" messaging |
| **$1/guest feels "too expensive" for small weddings** | Low — a 30-person wedding is only $30 | Low | $20 minimum already covers this; free tier for 10 guests lets them try first |
| **AI compute costs spike** | Medium — image generation costs could erode margins | Low | Cache watermark designs (one generation per wedding, applied to all photos); use efficient models; watermark is a one-time generation, not per-photo AI |
| **Storage costs at scale (video-heavy uploads)** | Low — margins compress if guests upload lots of video | Medium | Set per-event storage caps (e.g., 10GB included); compress/transcode uploads; offer extended storage as paid add-on |

## Appendix: AI Watermark & Filter Feature — Marketing Notes

### AI Watermark as a Marketing Differentiator

The AI-generated custom watermark is not just a feature — it's the single most marketable differentiator Event Cam has. Here's why:

- **Visual and shareable:** A beautiful watermark on a wedding photo is inherently Instagram/Pinterest/TikTok content. Couples will screenshot their watermark design and share it. This is free organic marketing.
- **Emotional:** The watermark has the couple's names and wedding date. It transforms a random guest phone photo into a personalized wedding keepsake.
- **Novel:** No competitor offers AI-generated watermarks. "The Guest" and similar apps have generic branding at best.
- **Proof of value:** When a couple sees the watermark on their photos, they immediately feel they got their money's worth. It's the visible manifestation of what they paid for.

### How to Talk About Watermarks in Marketing

- Don't say "watermark" in isolation — it sounds like stock photo protection. Say **"custom AI watermark"** or **"personalized wedding watermark."**
- Show, don't tell: every ad, every social post, every landing page should show a real photo with a beautiful watermark. The watermark sells itself visually.
- Position it as a "keepsake" or "signature" — "Every photo from your wedding, signed with your names."

### Filter Feature as a Secondary Hook

Filters are table stakes in the photo app world, but for wedding guest photos they serve a specific purpose:

- **Cohesion:** 150 guests with 150 different phone cameras and lighting conditions = wildly inconsistent album. A shared filter gives the whole collection a unified aesthetic.
- **Quality uplift:** Guest phone photos are often mediocre. A good filter makes them look intentionally stylistic rather than accidentally bad.
- **Fun for guests:** If guests can apply a filter during upload, it makes the experience more interactive and fun — increasing participation.

### Filter Marketing Angle

- "Your guests' phones are all different. Your album doesn't have to be."
- "One filter. Every phone. One beautiful, cohesive album."
- Before/after comparisons are extremely effective on social media.
