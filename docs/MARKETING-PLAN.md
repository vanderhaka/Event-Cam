## 1. Executive Summary

Event Cam solves a universal pain point: after any event — weddings, parties, corporate retreats, fundraisers — photos and videos are scattered across dozens of phones with no easy way to collect them. Existing solutions require guests to download an app or create an account, creating friction that kills participation.

Event Cam eliminates that friction entirely. Organizers create an event, add their guest list, and distribute unique QR codes. Guests scan a QR with their phone camera, upload media in their browser, and they're done. The organizer moderates submissions, builds curated albums, and shares them via password-protected links with optional view limits and expiration.

**Core marketing thesis:** Position Event Cam as the zero-friction, privacy-first alternative to "yet another app to download." Lead with the guest experience (scan → upload → done) because that simplicity is what organizers actually care about.

## 2. Target Audience

### Primary Segments

| Segment | Description | Pain Point | Willingness to Pay |
|---------|-------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Wedding couples / planners** | Couples planning weddings, or professional planners managing 50–300 guests | Photos stuck on guest phones; disposable cameras are expensive and low-quality | High — weddings already have large budgets |
| **Corporate event organizers** | Internal events, team offsites, conferences, holiday parties (20–500 attendees) | Need branded, moderated content; privacy/compliance concerns | High — expense-account budgets |
| **Social hosts** | Birthday parties, reunions, milestone celebrations (15–100 guests) | Want a shared album without creating a group chat or shared drive | Medium — price-sensitive but emotional purchase |

### Secondary Segments

| Segment | Description | Opportunity |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Photographers** | Professional event photographers who want a delivery/collaboration tool | Power users who bring repeat business and word-of-mouth |
| **Nonprofits & fundraisers** | Galas, charity runs, community events | Emotional content collection; potential nonprofit discount tier |
| **Schools & universities** | Proms, graduations, homecomings | High volume, strong word-of-mouth in parent networks |

### Buyer Persona: "Organized Olivia"

- 28–42 years old, planning a wedding or milestone birthday
- Comfortable with technology but not a power user
- Wants things to "just work" — hates asking guests to download apps
- Values privacy; doesn't want event photos on public social media
- Willing to pay a reasonable fee for a polished, stress-free experience

## 3. Value Proposition & Messaging

### One-Liner

> **Collect every photo from every guest — no app required.**

### Elevator Pitch

Event Cam gives event organizers a dead-simple way to collect photos and videos from every guest. Share a QR code, guests scan and upload from their phone browser — no downloads, no sign-ups, no friction. You moderate everything, build beautiful albums, and share them with password-protected links. Every memory, one place.

### Messaging Pillars

| Pillar | Message | Proof Point |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Zero friction** | "Scan. Upload. Done." — Guests never download an app or create an account | Browser-based upload; works on any phone |
| **Full control** | "Your event, your rules." — Moderate every photo before it's shared | Built-in approve/reject moderation queue |
| **Privacy-first** | "Private by default." — No public galleries, no social sharing leaks | Password-protected links with view limits and expiration |
| **Beautiful simplicity** | "From QR to album in minutes." — Not a complex platform, just the right tool | 4-step flow: create → invite → collect → share |

### Tagline Options

- "Every guest. Every photo. One place."
- "The event album that fills itself."
- "QR to album in minutes."
- "No app. No friction. Every memory."

## 4. Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses | Event Cam Advantage |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| **The Guest** (app) | Polished UI, established brand | Requires app download, subscription model | No download required |
| **WedUploader** | Wedding-focused features | Niche; limited to weddings | Works for any event type |
| **Google Photos shared albums** | Free, familiar | Requires Google account, no moderation, no privacy controls | Moderation + password-protected sharing |
| **Dropbox / Google Drive** | General-purpose file sharing | No curation, no QR workflow, messy at scale | Purpose-built for event media |
| **Social media (Instagram, Facebook)** | Ubiquitous | Public by default, no curation control, content buried in feeds | Private, curated, organizer-controlled |
| **Disposable cameras / film** | Nostalgia factor | Expensive, low quality, slow development | Instant, digital, high-quality |

**Positioning:** Event Cam sits in the sweet spot between "too simple" (shared albums) and "too complex" (full event platforms). It does one thing exceptionally well: frictionless photo/video collection with privacy and curation.

## 5. Pricing Strategy

### Recommended Model: Pay-Per-Event, Tiered by Guest Count

| Tier | Guests | Price | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|-------|
| **Starter** | Up to 25 | $9.99 | Birthday parties, small gatherings |
| **Standard** | Up to 100 | $24.99 | Weddings, corporate events |
| **Premium** | Up to 300 | $49.99 | Large weddings, conferences |
| **Enterprise** | 300+ | Custom | Conferences, festivals, multi-day events |

### Why Per-Event (Not Subscription)

- Matches how people buy: events are one-time occasions, not recurring needs
- Lower perceived commitment = higher conversion
- Aligns with the product's current Stripe checkout per invite count
- Can later introduce a "Planner Pro" subscription for repeat organizers (photographers, planners)

### Free Tier / Trial

- Allow organizers to create one event with up to 5 guests for free
- Full feature set — no feature gating, just guest-count limitation
- Converts to paid when they see the product works and want to scale up

### Future Upsell Opportunities

- Extended storage (keep albums beyond 90 days)
- Custom branding on the upload page (logos, colors)
- Analytics (upload rates, popular photos, engagement metrics)
- Video highlights / auto-slideshow generation
- Physical prints and photobook ordering

## 10. Metrics & KPIs

### North Star Metric

**Events with 10+ uploads** — This measures real engagement, not just signups. An event with 10+ uploads means the organizer successfully distributed QR codes and guests actually participated.

### Funnel Metrics

|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Awareness | Website visitors / month | 5,000 |
| Acquisition | Signups / month | 500 |
| Activation | Events created / month | 200 |
| Revenue | Paid events / month | 100 |
| Engagement | Avg uploads per event | 25+ |
| Retention | Repeat organizers (2+ events) | 15% |
| Referral | Referral-driven signups | 10% of new signups |

### Unit Economics Targets

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) | < $15 |
| Average Revenue Per Event | $20–$30 |
| Gross margin | > 75% (infra costs are low with Supabase) |
| Payback period | < 1 event (i.e., first event covers CAC) |

## 12. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Low guest participation** (guests don't scan QR) | High — product value depends on uploads | Medium | Provide organizers with tips, templates, and reminders; make QR prominent (table tents, signage); send post-scan "thank you" to reinforce behavior |
| **Privacy concerns** | High — media collection involves consent | Medium | Mandatory consent screen before upload (already built); clear privacy policy; GDPR compliance for EU expansion |
| **Competitor launches "no app" feature** | Medium — reduces differentiation | Medium | Move fast on moderation, albums, and sharing features; build brand loyalty before commoditization |
| **Wedding seasonality** | Medium — revenue concentration in May–October | High | Diversify into corporate events (year-round); holiday party push in Q4 |
| **Stripe/payment friction** | Medium — organizers may abandon at checkout | Low | Offer free tier to prove value first; optimize checkout flow; consider Apple Pay / Google Pay |
| **Storage costs at scale** | Low — margins compress with video-heavy uploads | Low | Set per-event storage caps; offer tiered storage pricing; compress/transcode uploads |
